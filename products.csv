    <h3>About the Box Bungalow models</h3>
    <p>Undue expense and red tape have been cut to keep the Box Bungalows 
user friendly and affordable. Most municipalities mandate that a permit 
is not required to put a building of less than 120 square feet on your 
property, though you'd want to check with your local building and zoning
 departments to be sure. While you're at it, see if there are any 
setback requirements that govern where a structure can be set or how it 
can officially be used.</p>
    <p>Our plans include a foundation on concrete footings, but the foundation choices are limitless.</p>
    <h3>Finishing the interior</h3>
    <p>Once you've got a shell, the interior fittings and finishes are 
entirely up to you. It can be used as a backyard bedroom, office, yoga 
retreat, or artist studio.</p>
    <p>A sleeping loft can be set on the collar ties overhead with ease, or 
you may choose to put a bed down stairs. You can also consider a Murphy 
bed or other foldaway furniture. Including a lot of storage is a great 
way to open up the area as much as possible for a sense of volume. 
Built-ins are also a great way to maximize space.</p>
    <div id=""first"" style=""display: block;""></div>


Pictured above are 5 unique examples of how the interior can be laid out. The options are limitless.

      <h3>Anderjack Plans include 19 total pages:</h3>
      <p><strong>Floor Plans</strong><br />
    Floor plans for both the main floor and optional loft includes pertinent dimensions for walls, the door, and optional windows.</p>
      <p><strong>Exterior Elevations</strong><br />
    These plans include 4 elevation drawings showing the front, back and both sides. Siding and facia boards are called out.</p>
      <p><strong>Electric Plans</strong><br />
    These pages include both the main floor and loft and show locations for outlets, light switches and lights.</p>
      <p><strong>Transverse Section</strong><br />
    Perhaps one of the most important pages on any set of plans, the  transverse section cuts the house in half and shows details such as wall  thickness, roofing material details, flooring details, roof pitch,  ceiling heights, and insulation.</p>
      <p><strong>Foundation Plan</strong><br />
    We include plans for poured pier or concrete block foundation, but this  house may also be placed on a slab or other appropriate foundation.  Floor framing for all the joists are also included, calling out treated  lumber as needed.</p>
      <p><strong>Framing Plans</strong><br />
    These plans show the framing for all 4 walls, both gables and lay out the exact location of each stud.</p>
      <p><strong>Roof Plan</strong><br />
    Showing the birds-eye view of the house, you see the slopes and pitches  clearly called out, as well as the amount of overhang, and individual  rafter locations from above for both the roof and porch. Also included  is the sheething plan for the roof which is designed so that soffits  aren't needed. </p>
      <p><strong>Door Detail</strong><br />
    The front door to this home is custom made from standard materials. We include plans to build the door.</p>
      <h3>What's not included</h3>
      <p><strong>Interior Details</strong><br />
    These homes are designed to be customized by you inside. These plans do not include any interior details.</p>
      <p><strong>Electric or Plumbing</strong><br />
    These plans do not include electric or plumbing. We suggest working with  a licensed electrician and plumber to make sure your house meets your  specific needs.</p>
      <p><strong>Architect or Engineer seals</strong><br />
    Some building departments require a licensed architect or engineer in  your state to approve any structure. Please consult your building  department.</p>
      <p><strong>Material List</strong><br />
    The plans do call out types of finish material and list specific window  sizes, however a material list showing framing materials and quantities  is not included.</p>
      <h3>Other Notes:</h3>
      <p><strong>Building Codes</strong><br />
    In many municipalities the Box Bungalow meets the codes for a shed.  Please consult your local building department to determine if this  structure can be used for your intended use.</p>
      <p><strong>Square Footage</strong><br />
    The square footage listed is an estimate. The square footage we list  includes the bottom floor. It does not include the loft or porch.</p>
      <p><strong>Altering Plans</strong><br />
    When you purchase a set of plans, it includes a license to build one  structure. Unfortunately, at this time, we don't offer alterations. We  spend approximately hundreds of hours on our plans, and the details are  incredibly specific. Alterations can easily run into thousands of  dollars since one little change affects so many things.</p>

<div>The B-53 is our largest home. It can be built as a 2 bedroom (777 sq 
ft) or 3 bedroom (874 sq ft) house. The 3rd bedroom is an optional 
add-on bedroom that is on the first floor level. The top floor houses 
two additional bedrooms. Each story of the house is 7'6"" tall at its 
peak. The upstairs bedrooms have sloped ceilings on the sides, and the 
closets are positioned in the lower ceiling space. The exterior height 
of the B-53 is 20' 9"". This house is not designed to be portable. We

    <h3>Cost to Build</h3>
    <p><strong>Estimated Material Costs: $51,000 (777 sq ft) or $58,000 (874 sq ft)</strong> </p>
    <p><strong>Want to know how much it will cost to have a contractor build it for you?</strong> <br />
Visit <a href=""http://www.building-cost.net/CornersType.asp"" target=""_new"">Build-Cost.net</a> and follow these <a href=""http://static.shopify.com/s/files/1/0150/9532/t/4/assets/Cost-Guide.pdf?4754"" target=""_new"">instructions</a>. </p>
    <p><em>General notes about construction costs:</em>Costs for materials 
are almost the same in different regions but labor costs will vary 
greatly depending on where you live. We provide costs with a raised 
perimeter concrete foundation. Depending on where you live, it is 
possible you will need an engineered foundation designed by a licensed 
contractor or engineer in your state.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Foundation</h3>
    <p>The house plans come with a post and pier foundation. However, it is 
possible to put this house on a slab foundation or even over a basement.
 You may need to work with an architect or engineer licensed in your 
state to get approval from the building department. </p>
    <p><strong>Can this house be built on wheels?<br />
</strong>No. This small house is designed to be built on a permanent foundation.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Utilities and appliances</h3>
    <p>The kitchen maximizes space and includes a dishwasher, full size 
range with oven, and built in microwave. The tank-less on demand water 
heater ensures that you never run out of hot water, and tucks away 
completely out of view. A stacking washer and dryer flank the kitchen. A
 small fireplace is tucked nicely in the corner of the great room. </p>
    <p><strong>Can I install air conditioning?</strong> <br />
Our plans do not include an air conditioning unit, however you can install one. </p>
    <p><strong>What type of fireplace does the house have?</strong> <br />
We do not specify a particular fire place or heater because codes vary so 
much based on climate. We recommend discussing your options with a 
building contractor licensed in your state. When you build this house, <em>please</em> send us pictures. Since we do not build the house ourselves, we are dependent on you to supply us with real pictures.</p>

    <h3>B-53 Construction Plans include 13 total pages:</h3>
    <p><strong>Floor Plans</strong><br />
Detailed floor plans for both the downstairs and loft include pertinent 
dimensions for walls, windows, rooms and door openings. You’ll also 
find the location of all appliances on these plans as well.</p>
    <p><strong>Exterior Elevations</strong><br />
These plans include 4 elevation drawings showing the front, back and both sides. Siding and facia boards are called out.</p>
    <p><strong>Electric Plans</strong><br />
These pages include both the main floor and loft and show locations for outlets, light switches and lights.</p>
    <p><strong>Transverse Section</strong><br />
Perhaps one of the most important pages on any set of plans, the 
transverse section cuts the house in half and shows details such as wall
 thickness, roofing material details, flooring details, roof pitch,

    <p><strong>Roof Plan</strong><br />
Showing the birds-eye view of the house, you see the slopes and pitches 
clearly called out, as well as the amount of overhang, and individual 
rafter locations from above.</p>
    <p><strong>Kitchen Detail</strong><br />
Unlike many other plans on the market, we include a full kitchen plan showing the location of all shelving, cabinetry and appliances as seen from 
both an aerial and frontal view. We use standard size cabinets available at 
most hardware stores.</p>

<strong>Material List</strong><br />
Includes windows, doors, water heater, bath tub/shower, kitchen sink, dishwasher, range, washer/dryer and more.

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <h3>What's not included</h3>
    <p><b>Heating requirements</b><br />Because they vary by region we do not 
include these. Our plans are designed with a single fireplace heater. 
Depending on where you live, you may need to work with a local architect
 or engineer to submit plans that meet local requirements.</p>
    <p><b>A cut sheet</b><br />Cut sheets show the quantity of lumber needed.
 We do suggest the types of materials, however the quantity of each is not 
included. Windows, doors, kitchen cabinets and appliances are included 
with the drawings.</p>
    <p><b>Architect or Engineer seals</b><br />Some building departments 
require a licensed architect or engineer in your state to approve the 
plans. This often has to do with regional safety or energy issues,for 
example, hurricane safety in Florida, fire safety in California, energy 
 efficiency in New York, etc. Please contact your local building 
department to learn about the requirements in your area.</p>
    <h3>Other Notes:</h3>
    <p><b>Building Codes</b><br />These plans have been designed to meet the 
International Building Code. Some municipalities have additional 
restrictions or requirements. Please check with your local building 
department to verify that these plans meet your local codes.</p>
    <p><b>Square Footage</b><br />The square footage listed is an estimate. 
Unfortunately, not all municipalities calculate square feet in the same 
way. The square footage we list includes the bottom floor, plus the 
space on the top floor where the ceiling height is 5’0” or taller.</p>
    <p><b>Altering Plans</b><br />
When you purchase a set of plans, it includes a license to build one 
house. Unfortunately, at this time, we do not offer alterations. If you 
require changes we suggest finding a local
architect or engineer who will do the alterations for you. For that 
purpose we have made the CAD and DFX files available online. With those 
files, your architect (or engineer) does not need to start from scratch; 
they can simply open the computer file and start making the adjustments 
you want.</p>
    <p>
</p>
    <p>TIP: Make sure the architect or engineer you select works with 
AutoCAD (or other similar software) and is willing to work with you on 
these plans. Some professionals will
only take a job if they do it from start to finish. By carefully 
selecting someone to work with these plans, you can save thousands of 
dollars.</p>

    <h3>About the Box Bungalow models</h3>
    <p>Undue expense and red tape have been cut to keep the Box Bungalows 
user friendly and affordable. Most municipalities mandate that a permit 
is not required to put a building of less than 120 square feet on your 
property, though you'd want to check with your local building and zoning
 departments to be sure. While you're at it, see if there are any 
setback requirements that govern where a structure can be set or how it 
can officially be used.</p>
    <p>Our plans include a foundation on concrete footings, but the foundation choices are limitless.</p>
    <h3>Finishing the interior</h3>
    <p>Once you've got a shell, the interior fittings and finishes are 
entirely up to you. It can be used as a backyard bedroom, office, yoga 
retreat, or artist studio.</p>
    <p>A sleeping loft can be set on the collar ties overhead with ease, or 
you may choose to put a bed down stairs. You can also consider a Murphy 
bed or other foldaway furniture. Including a lot of storage is a great 
way to open up the area as much as possible for a sense of volume. 
Built-ins are also a great way to maximize space.</p>
    <div id=""first"" style=""display: block;""></div>


Pictured above are 5 unique examples of how the interior can be laid out. The options are limitless.

      <h3>Beavan Plans include 19 total pages:</h3>
      <p><strong>Floor Plans</strong><br />
    Floor plans for both the main floor and optional loft includes pertinent dimensions for walls, the door, and optional windows.</p>
      <p><strong>Exterior Elevations</strong><br />
    These plans include 4 elevation drawings showing the front, back and both sides. Siding and facia boards are called out.</p>
      <p><strong>Electric Plans</strong><br />
    These pages include both the main floor and loft and show locations for outlets, light switches and lights.</p>
      <p><strong>Transverse Section</strong><br />
    Perhaps one of the most important pages on any set of plans, the  transverse section cuts the house in half and shows details such as wall  thickness, roofing material details, flooring details, roof pitch,  ceiling heights, and insulation.</p>
      <p><strong>Foundation Plan</strong><br />
    We include plans for poured pier or concrete block foundation, but this  house may also be placed on a slab or other appropriate foundation.  Floor framing for all the joists are also included, calling out treated  lumber as needed.</p>
      <p><strong>Framing Plans</strong><br />
    These plans show the framing for all 4 walls, both gables and lay out the exact location of each stud.</p>
      <p><strong>Roof Plan</strong><br />
    Showing the birds-eye view of the house, you see the slopes and pitches  clearly called out, as well as the amount of overhang, and individual  rafter locations from above for both the roof and porch. Also included  is the sheething plan for the roof which is designed so that soffits  aren't needed. </p>
      <p><strong>Door Detail</strong><br />
    The front door to this home is custom made from standard materials. We include plans to build the door.</p>
      <h3>What's not included</h3>
      <p><strong>Interior Details</strong><br />
    These homes are designed to be customized by you inside. These plans do not include any interior details.</p>
      <p><strong>Electric or Plumbing</strong><br />
    These plans do not include electric or plumbing. We suggest working with  a licensed electrician and plumber to make sure your house meets your  specific needs.</p>
      <p><strong>Architect or Engineer seals</strong><br />
    Some building departments require a licensed architect or engineer in  your state to approve any structure. Please consult your building  department.</p>
      <p><strong>Material List</strong><br />
    The plans do call out types of finish material and list specific window  sizes, however a material list showing framing materials and quantities  is not included.</p>
      <h3>Other Notes:</h3>
      <p><strong>Building Codes</strong><br />
    In many municipalities the Box Bungalow meets the codes for a shed.  Please consult your local building department to determine if this  structure can be used for your intended use.</p>
      <p><strong>Square Footage</strong><br />
    The square footage listed is an estimate. The square footage we list  includes the bottom floor. It does not include the loft or porch.</p>
      <p><strong>Altering Plans</strong><br />
    When you purchase a set of plans, it includes a license to build one  structure. Unfortunately, at this time, we don't offer alterations. We  spend approximately hundreds of hours on our plans, and the details are  incredibly specific. Alterations can easily run into thousands of  dollars since one little change affects so many things.</p>

    <h3>Cost to Build</h3>
    <p><strong>Estimated Material Costs: $22,500 (261 sq ft) or $29,500 (356 sq ft)</strong>
</p>
    <p><strong>Want to know how much it will cost to have a contractor build it for you?</strong><br />
  Visit <a href=""http://www.building-cost.net/CornersType.asp"" target=""_new"">Build-Cost.net</a> and follow these <a href=""http://static.shopify.com/s/files/1/0150/9532/t/4/assets/Cost-Guide.pdf?4754"" target=""_new"">instructions</a>.
</p>
    <p><em>General notes about construction costs:</em> Costs for materials 
are almost the same in different regions but labor costs will vary 
greatly depending on where you live. We provide costs with a raised 
perimeter concrete foundation. Depending on where you live, it is 
possible you will need an engineered foundation designed by a licensed 
contractor or engineer in your state.
</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Loft</h3>
    <p>We don't count the loft as square footage in this house because with 
so much sloped ceiling, it doesn't officially qualify as a habitable 
room. Subsequently, with seven feet of ceiling height over more than 50 
square feet, the loft provides a lot of usable space. The loft is 
accessed by a ladder in the kitchen. </p>
    <p><strong>Can I put in stairs instead of a ladder?</strong><br />
  No, stairs won't fit, but ""ladder stairs"" will.
</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Foundation</h3>
    <p>We sell our plans with a raised perimeter foundation. However, it is 
possible to put this house on a slab foundation or even over a basement.
 However, you may need to work with an architect or engineer licensed in
 your state to get approval from the building department. </p>
    <p><strong>Can this house be built on wheels?</strong><br />
No. This small house is designed to be built on a permanent foundation. </p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Utilities and appliances</h3>
    <p>The kitchen maximizes space and includes a dishwasher, full size 
range with oven, and built in microwave. The tank-less on demand water 
heater ensures that you never run out of hot water, and tucks away 
completely out of view. A small fireplace is tucked nicely in the corner
 of the great room.
  
The smaller version has a washer/dryer combo in the kitchen, whereas the
 larger version has a stack-able washer and dryer closet. </p>
    <p><strong>Can I install air conditioning?</strong><br />
Yes, you can. Our plans don't include an air conditioning unit, but you can install one in the loft or outside the house. </p>
    <p><strong>What type of fireplace does the house have?</strong><br />
  We don't specify a particular fire place or heater because codes vary so
 much based on climate. We recommend discussing your options with a 
building contractor licensed in your state. When you build this house, <em>please</em> send us pictures. Since we don't build the house ourselves, we are dependent on you to supply us with real pictures.

    <h3>Bodega Construction Plans include 13 total pages:</h3>
    <p>When you purchase these plans, you'll receive 2 sets:<br />
	</p>
    <li>A complete set of plans with a cathedral ceiling over the main room</li>
    <li>A complete set of plans with a full loft over the main room</li>
    <p><strong>Floor Plans</strong><br />
Detailed floor plans for both the downstairs and loft include pertinent 
dimensions for walls, windows, rooms and door openings. You'll also 
find the location of all appliances on these plans as well. Two loft 
plans are provided giving you an option of a cathedral ceiling over the 
main room, or extra loft space above.</p>
    <p><strong>Exterior Elevations</strong><br />
These plans include 4 elevation drawings showing the front, back and both sides. Siding and facia boards are called out.</p>
    <p><strong>Electric Plans</strong><br />
These pages include both the main floor and loft and show locations for outlets, light switches and lights.</p>
    <p><strong>Transverse Section</strong><br />
Perhaps one of the most important pages on any set of plans, the 
transverse section cuts the house in half and shows details such as wall
 thickness, roofing material details, flooring details, roof pitch, 
ceiling heights, and insulation.</p>

<strong>Foundation Plan</strong><br />
A perimeter foundation plan is included as well with floor joists.

          
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Roof Plan</strong><br />
Showing the birds-eye view of the house, you see the slopes and pitches 
clearly called out, as well as the amount of overhang, and individual 
rafter locations from above.</p>
    <p><strong>Kitchen Detail</strong><br />
Unlike many other plans on the market, we include a full kitchen plan, 
showing the location of all shelving, cabinetry and appliances as seen from 
both an aerial and frontal view. We use standard size cabinets available at 
most hardware stores.</p>

<strong>Material List</strong><br />
Includes windows, doors, water heater, bath tub/shower, kitchen sink, dishwasher, range, washer/dryer and more.

          
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>What's not included</h3>
    <p><b>Heating requirements</b><br />Because they vary by region we do not 
include these. Our plans are designed with a single fireplace heater. 
Depending on where you live, you may need to work with a local architect
 or engineer to submit plans that meet local requirements.</p>
    <p><b>A cut sheet</b><br />Cut sheets show the quantity of lumber needed.
 We do suggest the types of materials, however the quantity of each is not 
included. Windows, doors, kitchen cabinets and appliances are included 
with the drawings.</p>
    <p><b>Architect or Engineer seals</b><br />Some building departments 
require a licensed architect or engineer in your state to approve the 
plans. This often has to do with regional safety or energy issues,for 
example, hurricane safety in Florida, fire safety in California, energy 
 efficiency in New York, etc. Please contact your local building 
department to learn about the requirements in your area.</p>
    <h3>Other Notes:</h3>
    <p><b>Building Codes</b><br />These plans have been designed to meet the 
International Building Code. Some municipalities have additional 
restrictions or requirements. Please check with your local building 
department to verify that these plans meet your local codes.</p>
    <p><b>Square Footage</b><br />The square footage listed is an estimate. 
Unfortunately, not all municipalities calculate square feet in the same 
way. The square footage we list includes the bottom floor, plus the 
space on the top floor where the ceiling height is 5'0"" or taller.</p>
    <p><b>Altering Plans</b><br />
When you purchase a set of plans, it includes a license to build one 
house. Unfortunately, at this time, we do not offer alterations. If you 
require changes we suggest finding a local
architect or engineer who will do the alterations for you. For that 
purpose we have made the CAD and DFX files available online. With those 
files, your architect (or engineer) does not need to start from scratch; 
they can simply open the computer file and start making the adjustments 
you want.</p>
    <p>
</p>
    <p>TIP: Make sure the architect or engineer you select works with 
AutoCAD (or other similar software) and is willing to work with you on 
these plans. Some professionals will
only take a job if they do it from start to finish. By carefully 
selecting someone to work with these plans, you can save thousands of 
dollars.</p>

    <h3>Cost to Build</h3>
    <p><strong>Estimated Material Costs: $49,000 (746 sq ft) or $56,000 (843 sq ft)</strong> </p>
    <p><strong>Want to know how much it will cost to have a contractor build it for you?</strong> <br />
Visit <a href=""http://www.building-cost.net/CornersType.asp"" target=""_new"">Build-Cost.net</a> and follow these <a href=""http://static.shopify.com/s/files/1/0150/9532/t/4/assets/Cost-Guide.pdf?4754"" target=""_new"">instructions</a>. </p>
    <p><em>General notes about construction costs:</em>Costs for materials 
are almost the same in different regions but labor costs will vary 
greatly depending on where you live. We provide costs with a raised 
perimeter concrete foundation. Depending on where you live, it is 
possible you will need an engineered foundation designed by a licensed 
contractor or engineer in your state.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Foundation</h3>
    <p>The house plans come with a post and pier foundation. However, it is 
possible to put this house on a slab foundation or even over a basement.
 You may need to work with an architect or engineer licensed in your 
state to get approval from the building department. </p>
    <p><strong>Can this house be built on wheels?</strong><br />
No. This small house is designed to be built on a permanent foundation.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Utilities and appliances</h3>
    <p>The kitchen maximizes space and includes a dishwasher, full size 
range with oven, and built in microwave. The tank-less on demand water 
heater ensures that you never run out of hot water, and tucks away 
completely out of view. A stacking washer and dryer flank the kitchen. A
 small fireplace is tucked nicely in the corner of the great room. </p>
    <p><strong>Can I install air conditioning?</strong> <br />
Our plans do not include an air conditioning unit, however you can install one. </p>
    <p><strong>What type of fireplace does the house have?</strong> <br />
We do not specify a particular fire place or heater because codes vary so 
much based on climate. We recommend discussing your options with a 
building contractor licensed in your state. When you build this house, <em>please</em> send us pictures. Since we do not build the house ourselves, we are dependent on you to supply us with real pictures.</p>

    <h3>Enesti Construction Plans include 13 total pages:</h3>
    <p><strong>Floor Plans</strong><br />
Detailed floor plans for both the downstairs and loft include pertinent 
dimensions for walls, windows, rooms and door openings. You'll also 
find the location of all appliances on these plans as well.</p>
    <p><strong>Exterior Elevations</strong><br />
These plans include 4 elevation drawings showing the front, back and both sides. Siding and facia boards are called out.</p>
    <p><strong>Electric Plans</strong><br />
These pages include both the main floor and loft and show locations for outlets, light switches and lights.</p>
    <p><strong>Transverse Section</strong><br />
Perhaps one of the most important pages on any set of plans, the 
transverse section cuts the house in half and shows details such as wall
 thickness, roofing material details, flooring details, roof pitch, 
ceiling heights, and insulation.</p>

<strong>Foundation Plan</strong><br />
A perimeter foundation plan is included as well with floor joists.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Roof Plan</strong><br />
Showing the birds-eye view of the house, you see the slopes and pitches 
clearly called out, as well as the amount of overhang, and individual 
rafter locations from above.</p>
    <p><strong>Kitchen Detail</strong><br />
Unlike many other plans on the market, we include a full kitchen plan showing the location of all shelving, cabinetry and appliances as seen from 
both an aerial and frontal view. We use standard size cabinets available at 
most hardware stores.</p>

<strong>Material List</strong><br />
Includes windows, doors, water heater, bath tub/shower, kitchen sink, dishwasher, range, washer/dryer and more.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <h3>What's not included</h3>
    <p><b>Heating requirements</b><br />Because they vary by region we do not 
include these. Our plans are designed with a single fireplace heater. 
Depending on where you live, you may need to work with a local architect
 or engineer to submit plans that meet local requirements.</p>
    <p><b>A cut sheet</b><br />Cut sheets show the quantity of lumber needed.
 We do suggest the types of materials, however the quantity of each is not 
included. Windows, doors, kitchen cabinets and appliances are included 
with the drawings.</p>
    <p><b>Architect or Engineer seals</b><br />Some building departments 
require a licensed architect or engineer in your state to approve the 
plans. This often has to do with regional safety or energy issues,for 
example, hurricane safety in Florida, fire safety in California, energy 
 efficiency in New York, etc. Please contact your local building 
department to learn about the requirements in your area.</p>
    <h3>Other Notes:</h3>
    <p><b>Building Codes</b><br />These plans have been designed to meet the 
International Building Code. Some municipalities have additional 
restrictions or requirements. Please check with your local building 
department to verify that these plans meet your local codes.</p>
    <p><b>Square Footage</b><br />The square footage listed is an estimate. 
Unfortunately, not all municipalities calculate square feet in the same 
way. The square footage we list includes the bottom floor, plus the 
space on the top floor where the ceiling height is 5'0"" or taller.</p>
    <p><b>Altering Plans</b><br />
When you purchase a set of plans, it includes a license to build one 
house. Unfortunately, at this time, we do not offer alterations. If you 
require changes we suggest finding a local
architect or engineer who will do the alterations for you. For that 
purpose we have made the CAD and DFX files available online. With those 
files, your architect (or engineer) does not need to start from scratch; 
they can simply open the computer file and start making the adjustments 
you want.</p>
    <p>
</p>
    <p>TIP: Make sure the architect or engineer you select works with 
AutoCAD (or other similar software) and is willing to work with you on 
these plans. Some professionals will
only take a job if they do it from start to finish. By carefully 
selecting someone to work with these plans, you can save thousands of 
dollars.</p>

          <h3>Living Room</h3>
The living room comes with a built in desk (which can also be built without a desk), and is warmed by the <a href=""/pages/heaters/"">stainless steel fireplace</a>. The four windows that surround the living room make this space very bright.
      

        
          
          
          
          
          
          <h3>Kitchen</h3>
          <p>The kitchen features a sink, 2 burner stove top, refrigerator, and 
ample shelving. Below the sink, there is a small water heater, and the 
refrigerator. There is also space where you can store a small toaster 
oven or microwave if you choose. </p>
          <p><strong>Can I add a dishwasher or laundry to the kitchen?</strong><br />
The kitchen is too small, but a washer/dryer combo can be placed in the lower half of the closet (back left of living room). </p>
          <h3>Bedroom</h3>
The bedroom is in the loft. It is large enough to fit a queen size bed, 
but that said, this house is a little small for 2 people. The mattress 
is foam (or like kind) so that it can be rolled up and fit through the 
loft opening. The loft also has shelving for clothing. At its peak, the 
loft height is 3'-8"".
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
          
          
          
          
          
          <h3>Bathroom</h3>
          <p>Like on many boats, the bathroom is the shower … and it is called a 
""wet bath"". We use metal diamond plate finishing on the walls that leave
 it with a modern look. The shower water is heated from the small water 
heater under the kitchen sink, and can last about 5 minutes.  </p>
          <p>The toilet is a low flush RV toilet designed to conserve water. You can easily substitute a composting toilet. </p>
          <h3>Efficient and Warm</h3>
          <p>The Epu features a <a href=""/pages/heaters/"">stainless steel fireplace</a>
 which keeps this house warm in temperatures -35 F. Because of its small
 size, its 16R insulation is sufficient to keep this house warm in the 
harshest of climates. By increasing the heater size to the Dickinson 
P-12000, the house can stay warm anywhere in Canada and Alaska. All four
 walls, the floor and the roof are insulated using polystyrene foam 
board which can withstand the rigors of road travel.
</p>
          <p><strong>Can I add air conditioning?</strong><br />
Yes, a small ceiling a/c unit can be added to keep the house cool in any climate within the US. </p>
          <h3>Trailer</h3>
          <p>This house is built on a 7' x 14' utility trailer. <a href=""http://www.bigtextrailers.com/pdf/70pi.pdf"">See spec sheet.</a><br />
  To learn more about utility trailers, <a href=""/blogs/tumbleweed/5912813-trailers"">read this...</a><br />
  Here is a <a href=""/pages/trailers/#14"">list of stores</a> that sell the trailer needed to build the Epu.
</p>
          <p><strong>Do I have to build it on a trailer?</strong><br />
  Because of its tiny size, it doesn't meet the minimum size standards 
required for houses on a foundation. That said, it can be built as a 
shed (without a kitchen) on a foundation.

          <div style=""line-height:14px;color:#5e464d"">The plans show the location of outlets, lights, and fixtures, but do not include plans showing the location of pipes and wires inside the wall. Also, plans do not suggest types of wiring or plumbing pipes to use. We suggest working with a licensed electrician and plumber to make sure your house meets your specific needs.

          <div style=""line-height:14px;color:#5e464d"">Some building departments require a licensed architect or engineer in your state to approve the plans. This often has to do with regional safety or energy issues,for example, hurricane safety in Florida, fire safety in California, energy efficiency in New York, etc. Please contact your local building department to learn about the requirements in your area.

          <div style=""line-height:14px;color:#5e464d"">When you purchase a set of plans, it includes a license to build one house. Unfortunately, at this time, we don't offer alterations. We spend approximately 250-500 hours on these plans, and the details are incredibly specific. Alterations can easily run into thousands of dollars since one little change affects so many things.

The EPU is the first Tumbleweed; and also the iconic image of a tiny house. Featured on Oprah, Yahoo, MSN, NBC, CBS, and hundreds more.

</div>
<br />
The EPU is the first Tumbleweed designed and built. You can see inside this home when it was  <a href=""http://www.oprah.com/slideshow/oprahshow/slideshow2_ss_decor_20070220"" target=""_blank"">featured on Oprah</a>. The EPU comes with a desk and <a href=""/pages/heaters/"">fireplace</a> in the main room; a kitchen; wet bath; and a loft upstairs. For its small size, the EPU has a large amount of storage space.

          <h3>Take a Tour Inside the Epu</h3>
          <iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/SbRvsWuWNUM"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""338"" width=""600""></iframe>
          <h3>Living Room</h3>
The living room comes with a built in desk (which can also be built without a desk), and is warmed by the <a href=""/pages/heaters/"">stainless steel fireplace</a>. The four windows that surround the living room make this space very bright.
      

        
          
          
          
          
          <h3>Kitchen</h3>
          <p>The kitchen features a sink, 2 burner stove top, refrigerator, and 
ample shelving. Below the sink, there is a small water heater, and the 
refrigerator. There is also space where you can store a small toaster 
oven or microwave if you choose. </p>
          <p><strong>Can I add a dishwasher or laundry to the kitchen?</strong><br />
The kitchen is too small, but a washer/dryer combo can be placed in the lower half of the closet (back left of living room). </p>
          <h3>Bedroom</h3>
The bedroom is in the loft. It is large enough to fit a queen size bed, 
but that said, this house is a little small for 2 people. The mattress 
is foam (or like kind) so that it can be rolled up and fit through the 
loft opening. The loft also has shelving for clothing. At its peak, the 
loft height is 3'-8"".
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
          
          
          
          
          <h3>Bathroom</h3>
          <p>Like on many boats, the bathroom is the shower … and it is called a 
""wet bath"". We use metal diamond plate finishing on the walls that leave
 it with a modern look. The shower water is heated from the small water 
heater under the kitchen sink, and can last about 5 minutes.  </p>
          <p>The toilet is a low flush RV toilet designed to conserve water. You can easily substitute a composting toilet. </p>
          <h3>Efficient and Warm</h3>
          <p>The Epu features a <a href=""/pages/heaters/"">stainless steel fireplace</a>
 which keeps this house warm in temperatures -35 F. Because of its small
 size, its 16R insulation is sufficient to keep this house warm in the 
harshest of climates. By increasing the heater size to the Dickinson 
P-12000, the house can stay warm anywhere in Canada and Alaska. All four
 walls, the floor and the roof are insulated using polystyrene foam 
board which can withstand the rigors of road travel.
</p>
          <p><strong>Can I add air conditioning?</strong><br />
Yes, a small ceiling a/c unit can be added to keep the house cool in any climate within the US. </p>
          <h3>Trailer</h3>
          <p>This house is built on a 7' x 14' utility trailer. <a href=""http://www.bigtextrailers.com/pdf/70pi.pdf"">See spec sheet.</a><br />
  To learn more about utility trailers, <a href=""/blogs/tumbleweed/5912813-trailers"">read this...</a><br />
  Here is a <a href=""/pages/trailers/#14"">list of stores</a> that sell the trailer needed to build the Epu.
</p>
          <p><strong>Do I have to build it on a trailer?</strong><br />
  Because of its tiny size, it doesn't meet the minimum size standards 
required for houses on a foundation. That said, it can be built as a 
shed (without a kitchen) on a foundation.

We spend approximately 250-500 hours on these plans, and the details are incredibly specific. Alterations can easily run into thousands of dollars since one little change affects so many things.

        <h3>
	Living Room</h3>
        <p>
	The ""living room"" is flooded with light from all of the windows surrounding the front of the house. The <a href=""/pages/heaters/"">stainless steel fireplace</a> warms
 the house amazingly well. The nook is large enough to store a day bed, 
futon, or small couch. Above the living room is a cathedral ceiling 
which makes this space feel very large.</p>
        <h3>
	&nbsp;</h3>
        <h3>
	Kitchen</h3>
        <p>
	This is the largest kitchen of all of our houses on wheels. It comes with a
 sink, 2 burner stove top, refrigerator, and ample shelving. Below the 
sink, there is a small water heater. There is enough space that you can 
choose between a small toaster oven, microwave, washer/dryer, or 
dishwasher if you choose.</p>
        <h3>
	&nbsp;</h3>
        <h3>
	Bedroom</h3>
        <p>
	The bedroom is in the loft. It is large enough to fit a queen size bed,
 but with that said, this house is a little small for 2 people. The mattress 
is foam (or like kind) so that it can be rolled up and fit through the 
loft opening. The loft also has shelving for clothing. At its peak, the 
loft height is 3'-8"".</p>
        <h3>
	&nbsp;</h3>
        <h3>
	Bathroom</h3>
        <p>
	The bathroom has both a toilet and a separate shower. The shower water 
is heated from the small water heater under the kitchen sink, and can 
last about 5 minutes. It doesn't come with a hand sink, but it is 
possible to install a hand sink above the toilet as is common in Japan. 
The toilet is a low flush RV toilet designed to conserve water. You can 
easily substitute a composting toilet.</p>
        <h3>
	&nbsp;</h3>
        <h3>
	Efficient and Warm</h3>
        <p>
	The Fencl features a <a href=""/pages/heaters/"">stainless steel fireplace</a>
 which keeps this house warm in temperatures -35 F. Because of its small
 size, its 16R insulation is sufficient to keep this house warm in the 
harshest of climates of the continental US and Southern Canada. Heading 
north of Southern Canada? You can easily install a larger heater, or 
second heater. All four walls, the floor and the roof are insulated 
using polystyrene foam board which can withstand the rigors of road 
travel.</p>
        <p>
	<strong>Can I add air conditioning?<br />
	</strong>Yes, a small ceiling a/c unit can be added to keep the house cool in any climate within the US.</p>
        <h3>
	&nbsp;</h3>
        <h3>
	Trailer</h3>
        <p>
	This house is built on a 7' x 18' utility trailer. <a href=""http://www.bigtextrailers.com/pdf/70pi.pdf"">See spec sheet.</a> To learn more about utility trailers, <a href=""/blogs/tumbleweed/5929707-40-tiny-houses-in-40-days-day-34"">read this...</a> Here is a <a href=""/pages/trailers/#18"">list of stores</a> that sell the trailer needed to build the Fencl.</p>
        <p>
	<strong>Do I have to build it on a trailer?</strong><br />
	Because of its tiny size, it doesn't meet the minimum size standards 
required for houses on a foundation. It is also too large to be built as
 a shed.</p>

free-vardo-plans,Free Vardo Plans,"<h3>The Vardo</h3>
<p>The Vardo is designed to nest inside most truck beds. It can also 
be pulled on its own trailer. The material costs to build this structure
 are approximately $2,500 (not including the optional heater).</p>
<p>It has enough room for a full-sized bed flanked by a couple of work surfaces. Underneath is 35 cubic feet of storage space.</p>
<p>The Vardo is not designed as a “house”. It doesn’t have a kitchen or bathroom.</p>
<p>We built the first model utilizing a recycled stained glass window in the front door.</p>
<p>A heater can be added to warm your cabin on cold nights.
</p>
<p><strong>Can I add air conditioning?</strong><br />
 Yes, a small ceiling a/c unit can be added to keep the house cool in any climate within the US.</p>
<p><strong>What type of truck can I build this in?</strong><br /> These 
plans are designed with the most popular Ford 150 truck in mind. 
However, you can easily build it longer or shorter as needed to meet the
 requirements of your truck.</p>

    <h3>About the Box Bungalow models</h3>
    <p>Undue expense and red tape have been cut to keep the Box Bungalows user friendly and affordable. Most municipalities mandate that a permit is not required to put a building of less than 120 square feet on your property, though you’d want to check with your local building and zoning departments to be sure. While you’re at it, see if there are any setback requirements that govern where a structure can be set or how it can officially be used.</p>
    <p>Our plans include a foundation on concrete footings, but the foundation choices are limitless.</p>
    <h3>Finishing the interior</h3>
    <p>Once you’ve got a shell, the interior fittings and finishes are entirely up to you. It can be used as a backyard bedroom, office, yoga retreat, or artist studio.</p>
    <p>A sleeping loft can be set on the collar ties overhead with ease, or you may choose to put a bed down stairs. You can also consider a Murphy bed or other foldaway furniture. Including a lot of storage is a great way to open up the area as much as possible for a sense of volume. Built-ins are also a great way to maximize space.</p>
    <div id=""first"" style=""display: block;""></div>


Pictured above are 5 unique examples of how the interior can be laid out. The options are limitless.


</div>
  <div id=""third"" style=""display: none;"">
    <h3>Gifford Plans include 19 total pages:</h3>
    <p><strong>Floor Plans</strong><br />
Floor plans for both the main floor and optional loft includes pertinent dimensions for walls, the door, and optional windows.</p>
    <p><strong>Exterior Elevations</strong><br />
These plans include 4 elevation drawings showing the front, back and both sides. Siding and facia boards are called out.</p>
    <p><strong>Electric Plans</strong><br />
These pages include both the main floor and loft and show locations for outlets, light switches and lights.</p>
    <p><strong>Transverse Section</strong><br />
Perhaps one of the most important pages on any set of plans, the transverse section cuts the house in half and shows details such as wall thickness, roofing material details, flooring details, roof pitch, ceiling heights, and insulation.</p>
    <p><strong>Foundation Plan</strong><br />
We include plans for poured pier or concrete block foundation, but this house may also be placed on a slab or other appropriate foundation. Floor framing for all the joists are also included, calling out treated lumber as needed.</p>
    <p><strong>Framing Plans</strong><br />
These plans show the framing for all 4 walls, both gables and lay out the exact location of each stud.</p>
    <p><strong>Roof Plan</strong><br />
Showing the birds-eye view of the house, you see the slopes and pitches clearly called out, as well as the amount of overhang, and individual rafter locations from above for both the roof and porch. Also included is the sheething plan for the roof which is designed so that soffits aren't needed.
</p>
    <p><strong>Door Detail</strong><br />
The front door to this home is custom made from standard materials. We include plans to build the door.</p>
    <h3>What's not included</h3>
    <p><strong>Interior Details</strong><br />
These homes are designed to be customized by you inside. These plans do not include any interior details.</p>
    <p><strong>Electric or Plumbing</strong><br />
These plans do not include electric or plumbing. We suggest working with a licensed electrician and plumber to make sure your house meets your specific needs.</p>
    <p><strong>Architect or Engineer seals</strong><br />
Some building departments require a licensed architect or engineer in your state to approve any structure. Please consult your building department.</p>
    <p><strong>Material List</strong><br />
The plans do call out types of finish material and list specific window sizes, however a material list showing framing materials and quantities is not included.</p>
    <h3>Other Notes:</h3>
    <p><strong>Building Codes</strong><br />
In many municipalities the Box Bungalow meets the codes for a shed. Please consult your local building department to determine if this structure can be used for your intended use.</p>
    <p><strong>Square Footage</strong><br />
The square footage listed is an estimate. The square footage we list includes the bottom floor. It does not include the loft or porch.</p>
    <p><strong>Altering Plans</strong><br />
When you purchase a set of plans, it includes a license to build one structure. Unfortunately, at this time, we don’t offer alterations. We spend approximately hundreds of hours on our plans, and the details are incredibly specific. Alterations can easily run into thousands of dollars since one little change affects so many things</p>

    <h3>Cost to Build</h3>
    <p><strong>Estimated Material Costs: $26,000 (310 sq ft) or $33,000 (404 sq ft)</strong> </p>
    <p><strong>Want to know how much it will cost to have a contractor build it for you?</strong> <br />
Visit <a href=""http://www.building-cost.net/CornersType.asp"" target=""_new"">Build-Cost.net</a> and follow these <a href=""http://static.shopify.com/s/files/1/0150/9532/t/4/assets/Cost-Guide.pdf?4754"" target=""_new"">instructions</a>. </p>
    <p><em>General notes about construction costs:</em>Costs for materials 
are almost the same in different regions but labor costs will vary 
greatly depending on where you live. We provide costs with a poured 
concrete perimeter foundation. Depending on where you live, it is 
possible you will need an engineered foundation designed by a licensed 
contractor or engineer in your state.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Loft</h3>
    <p>We do not count the loft as square footage in this house because at 
its peak, it is 6'8"" tall, and therefore it does not officially qualify 
as a habitable room. Subsequently, the loft adds over 100 feet of usable 
space and it is accessed by a <a href=""http://www.easy2diy.com/cm/easy/diy_ht_index.asp?page_id=35720153"">drop down stair ladder</a>.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Foundation</h3>
    <p>We sell our plans with a poured concrete perimeter foundation. 
However, it is possible to put this house on a slab foundation or even 
over a basement. However, you may need to work with an architect or 
engineer licensed in your state to get approval from the building 
department. </p>
    <p><strong>Can this house be built on wheels?</strong><br />
No. This house is designed to be built on a permanent foundation.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Utilities and appliances</h3>
    <p>The kitchen maximizes space and includes a dishwasher, full size 
range with oven, and built in microwave. The tank-less on demand water 
heater ensures that you never run out of hot water, and tucks away 
completely out of view. A small fireplace is tucked nicely in the corner
 of the great room. A washer/dryer combo in the kitchen makes this home 
complete.</p>
    <p> <strong>Can I install air conditioning?</strong> <br />
Yes, you can. Our plans do not include an air conditioning unit, but you can install one in the loft or outside of the house. </p>
    <p><strong>What type of fireplace does the house have?</strong> <br />
We do not specify a particular fire place or heater because codes vary so 
much based on climate. We recommend discussing your options with a 
building contractor licensed in your state. When you build this house, <em>please</em> send us pictures. Since we do not build the house ourselves, we are dependent on you to supply us with real pictures.</p>

    <h3>Harbinger Construction Plans include 13 total pages:</h3>
    <p>When you purchase these plans, you'll receive 2 sets:<br />
	</p>
    <li>A complete set of plans with a cathedral ceiling over the main room</li>
    <li>A complete set of plans with a full loft over the main room</li>
    <p><strong>Floor Plans</strong><br />
Detailed floor plans for both the downstairs and loft include pertinent 
dimensions for walls, windows, rooms and door openings. You'll also 
find the location of all appliances on these plans as well. Two loft 
plans are provided giving you an option of a cathedral ceiling over the 
main room, or extra loft space above.</p>
    <p><strong>Exterior Elevations</strong><br />
These plans include 4 elevation drawings showing the front, back and both sides. Siding and facia boards are called out.</p>
    <p><strong>Electric Plans</strong><br />
These pages include both the main floor and loft and show locations for outlets, light switches and lights.</p>
    <p><strong>Transverse Section</strong><br />
Perhaps one of the most important pages on any set of plans, the 
transverse section cuts the house in half and shows details such as wall
 thickness, roofing material details, flooring details, roof pitch, 
ceiling heights, and insulation.</p>

<strong>Foundation Plan</strong><br />
A perimeter foundation plan is included as well with floor joists.

          
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
      
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Roof Plan</strong><br />
Showing the birds-eye view of the house, you see the slopes and pitches 
clearly called out, as well as the amount of overhang, and individual 
rafter locations from above.</p>
    <p><strong>Kitchen Detail</strong><br />
Unlike many other plans on the market, we include a full kitchen plan showing location of all shelving, cabinetry and appliances as seen from 
both an aerial and frontal view. We use standard size cabinets available at 
most hardware stores.</p>

<strong>Material List</strong><br />
Includes windows, doors, water heater, bath tub/shower, kitchen sink, dishwasher, range, washer/dryer and more.

          
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
      
    
    
    
    <h3>What's not included</h3>
    <p><b>Heating requirements</b><br />Because they vary by region we do not 
include these. Our plans are designed with a single fireplace heater. 
Depending on where you live, you may need to work with a local architect
 or engineer to submit plans that meet local requirements.</p>
    <p><b>A cut sheet</b><br />Cut sheets show the quantity of lumber needed.
 We do suggest the types of materials, however the quantity of each is not 
included. Windows, doors, kitchen cabinets and appliances are included 
with the drawings.</p>
    <p><b>Architect or Engineer seals</b><br />Some building departments 
require a licensed architect or engineer in your state to approve the 
plans. This often has to do with regional safety or energy issues,for 
example, hurricane safety in Florida, fire safety in California, energy 
 efficiency in New York, etc. Please contact your local building 
department to learn about the requirements in your area.</p>
    <h3>Other Notes:</h3>
    <p><b>Building Codes</b><br />These plans have been designed to meet the 
International Building Code. Some municipalities have additional 
restrictions or requirements. Please check with your local building 
department to verify that these plans meet your local codes.</p>
    <p><b>Square Footage</b><br />The square footage listed is an estimate. 
Unfortunately, not all municipalities calculate square feet in the same 
way. The square footage we list includes the bottom floor, plus the 
space on the top floor where the ceiling height is 5'0"" or taller.</p>
    <p><b>Altering Plans</b><br />
When you purchase a set of plans, it includes a license to build one 
house. Unfortunately, at this time, we do not offer alterations. If you 
require changes we suggest finding a local
architect or engineer who will do the alterations for you. For that 
purpose we have made the CAD and DFX files available online. With those 
files, your architect (or engineer) does not need to start from scratch; 
they can simply open the computer file and start making the adjustments 
you want.</p>
    <p>
</p>
    <p>TIP: Make sure the architect or engineer you select works with 
AutoCAD (or other similar software) and is willing to work with you on 
these plans. Some professionals will
only take a job if they do it from start to finish. By carefully 
selecting someone to work with these plans, you can save thousands of 
dollars.</p>

  <p>Designed as a very small bungalow, the Loring comes with several 
options to suit your needs. You can choose between a sleeping loft 
upstairs, or a cathedral ceiling. We also have a larger version with a 
downstairs bedroom at the back of the house. It is the same floor plan 
as the <a href=""http://www.tumbleweedhouses.com/products/bodega/"">Bodega</a>,
 except that the roof line makes the curbside appearance very different.
 Designed with simplicity in mind, this house home has an abundance of 
light, and yet is very simply designed. The house is 16' 10"" tall. This 
house is not designed to be portable. We sell the plans to build it on location.</p>

    <h3>Cost to Build</h3>
    <p><strong>Estimated Material Costs: $22,500 (261 sq ft) or $29,500 (356 sq ft)</strong> </p>
    <p><strong>Want to know how much it will cost to have a contractor build it for you?</strong> <br />
Visit <a href=""http://www.building-cost.net/CornersType.asp"" target=""_new"">Build-Cost.net</a> and follow these <a href=""http://static.shopify.com/s/files/1/0150/9532/t/4/assets/Cost-Guide.pdf?4754"" target=""_new"">instructions</a>. </p>
    <p><em>General notes about construction costs:</em>Costs for materials 
are almost the same in different regions but labor costs will vary 
greatly depending on where you live. We provide costs with a poured 
concrete perimeter foundation. Depending on where you live, it is 
possible you will need an engineered foundation designed by a licensed 
contractor or engineer in your state.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Loft</h3>
    <p>We don't count the loft as square footage in this house because with 
so much sloped ceiling, it doesn't officially qualify as a habitable 
room. Subsequently, the loft can add over 100 feet of usable space, and it 
is accessed by a <a href=""http://www.easy2diy.com/cm/easy/diy_ht_index.asp?page_id=35720153"">drop down stair ladder</a>. At its highest point the loft is 6' 4"" tall, which encompasses over 50 square feet of space.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Foundation</h3>
    <p>We sell our plans with a poured concrete perimeter foundation. 
However, it is possible to put this house on a slab foundation or even 
over a basement. However, you may need to work with an architect or 
engineer licensed in your state to get approval from the building 
department. </p>
    <p><strong>C</strong><strong>an this house be built on wheels?</strong><br />
No. This house is designed to be built on a permanent foundation.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Utilities and appliances</h3>
    <p>The kitchen maximizes space and includes a dishwasher, full size 
range with oven, and built in microwave. The tank-less on demand water 
heater ensures that you never run out of hot water, and tucks away 
completely out of view. A small fireplace is tucked nicely in the corner
 of the great room. The smaller version has a washer/dryer combo in the 
kitchen, whereas the larger version has a stack-able washer and dryer 
closet. </p>
    <p><strong>Can I install air conditioning?</strong> <br />
Yes, you can. Our plans do not include an air conditioning unit, but you can install one in the loft or outside of the house. </p>
    <p><strong>What type of fireplace does the house have?</strong> <br />
We don't specify a particular fire place or heater because codes vary so 
much based on climate. We recommend discussing your options with a 
building contractor licensed in your state. When you build this house, <em>please</em> send us pictures. Since we don't build the house ourselves, we are dependent on you to supply us with real pictures.</p>

    <h3>Loring Construction Plans include 13 total pages:</h3>
When you purchase these plans, you'll receive 2 sets:

          
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <li>A complete set of plans with a cathedral ceiling over the main room</li>
    <li>A complete set of plans with a full loft over the main room</li>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Floor Plans</strong><br />
Detailed floor plans for both the downstairs and loft include pertinent 
dimensions for walls, windows, rooms and door openings. You'll also 
find the location of all appliances on these plans as well. Two loft 
plans are provided, giving you an option of a cathedral ceiling over the 
main room, or extra loft space above.</p>
    <p><strong>Exterior Elevations</strong><br />
These plans include 4 elevation drawings showing the front, back and both sides. Siding and facia boards are called out.</p>
    <p><strong>Electric Plans</strong><br />
These pages include both the main floor and loft and show locations for outlets, light switches and lights.</p>
    <p><strong>Transverse Section</strong><br />
Perhaps one of the most important pages on any set of plans, the 
transverse section cuts the house in half and shows details such as wall
 thickness, roofing material details, flooring details, roof pitch, 
ceiling heights, and insulation.</p>

<strong>Foundation Plan</strong><br />
A perimeter foundation plan is included as well with floor joists.

          
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Roof Plan</strong><br />
Showing the birds-eye view of the house, you see the slopes and pitches 
clearly called out, as well as the amount of overhang, and individual 
rafter locations from above.</p>
    <p><strong>Kitchen Detail</strong><br />
Unlike many other plans on the market, we include a full kitchen plan showing the location of all shelving, cabinetry and appliances as seen from 
both an aerial and frontal view. We use standard size cabinets available at 
most hardware stores.</p>

<strong>Material List</strong><br />
Includes windows, doors, water heater, bath tub/shower, kitchen sink, dishwasher, range, washer/dryer and more.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>What's not included</h3>
    <p><b>Heating requirements</b><br />Because they vary by region we do not 
include these. Our plans are designed with a single fireplace heater. 
Depending on where you live, you may need to work with a local architect
 or engineer to submit plans that meet local requirements.</p>
    <p><b>A cut sheet</b><br />Cut sheets show the quantity of lumber needed.
 We do suggest the types of materials, however the quantity of each is not 
included. Windows, doors, kitchen cabinets and appliances are included 
with the drawings.</p>
    <p><b>Architect or Engineer seals</b><br />Some building departments 
require a licensed architect or engineer in your state to approve the 
plans. This often has to do with regional safety or energy issues,for 
example, hurricane safety in Florida, fire safety in California, energy 
 efficiency in New York, etc. Please contact your local building 
department to learn about the requirements in your area.</p>
    <h3>Other Notes:</h3>
    <p><b>Building Codes</b><br />These plans have been designed to meet the 
International Building Code. Some municipalities have additional 
restrictions or requirements. Please check with your local building 
department to verify that these plans meet your local codes.</p>
    <p><b>Square Footage</b><br />The square footage listed is an estimate. 
Unfortunately, not all municipalities calculate square feet in the same 
way. The square footage we list includes the bottom floor, plus the 
space on the top floor where the ceiling height is 5'0"" or taller.</p>
    <p><b>Altering Plans</b><br />
When you purchase a set of plans, it includes a license to build one 
house. Unfortunately, at this time, we do not offer alterations. If you 
require changes we suggest finding a local
architect or engineer who will do the alterations for you. For that 
purpose we have made the CAD and DFX files available online. With those 
files, your architect (or engineer) does not need to start from scratch; 
they can simply open the computer file and start making the adjustments 
you want.</p>
    <p>
</p>
    <p>TIP: Make sure the architect or engineer you select works with 
AutoCAD (or other similar software) and is willing to work with you on 
these plans. Some professionals will
only take a job if they do it from start to finish. By carefully 
selecting someone to work with these plans, you can save thousands of 
dollars.</p>

%FullDescription%
  The Lusby is popular for its downstairs bedroom with extra loft sleeping
 above. The kitchen/main room has vaulted ceilings which make this tiny 
house feel much larger than it really is. The outside can be finished 
with board and baton siding, cedar plank (shown above) or corrugated 
aluminum (<a href=""http://www.tumbleweedhouses.com/products/tarleton/"">see Tarleton</a>).
 The roof is covered with corrugated aluminum - and yes, you can hear 
the rain. The interior is completely finished in pine with stainless 
steel counters. The bathroom has a full shower, toilet and sink.

        <h3>Living Room</h3>
The ""living room"" is shared with the kitchen, and is warmed by the <a href=""/pages/heaters/"">stainless steel fireplace</a>.
 The open ceiling above makes the space feel very roomy. The entry to 
the living room is flanked by two full size closets perfect for storing 
clothes.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        
        
        <h3> </h3>
        <h3>Kitchen</h3>
        <p>The custom built kitchenette runs the length of the living room and 
features a sink, 2 burner stove top, and refrigerator. Below the sink, 
there is a small water heater. </p>
        <p><strong>Can I add a dishwasher or laundry to the kitchen?</strong><br />
The kitchen is too small to add any more appliances. </p>
        <h3> </h3>
        <h3>Bedroom</h3>
The main downstairs bedroom is a little less than 4' wide. It is great 
for sleeping one person, but a tight fit for two people. The loft can 
also be used for sleeping and comfortably fits a queen sized mattress. 
Because the loft is open, a conventional mattress can easily be put 
inside. At its peak, the loft height is 3'-8"".
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        
        
        <h3> </h3>
        <h3>Bathroom</h3>
The Lusby is our only house on wheels that features a full bathroom with
 shower, toilet and hand sink. The small water heater allows one to take
 a warm, 5 minute shower. The toilet is a low flush RV toilet designed to
 conserve water. You can easily substitute a composting toilet.  
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        
        
        <h3> </h3>
        <h3>Efficient and Warm</h3>
        <p>The Lusby features a <a href=""/pages/heaters/"">stainless steel fireplace</a>
 which keeps this house warm in temperatures -35 F. Because of its small
 size, its 16R insulation is sufficient to keep this house warm in the 
harshest of climates of the continental US and Southern Canada. Heading 
north of Southern Canada? You can easily install a larger heater, or 
second heater. All four walls, the floor and the roof are insulated 
using polystyrene foam board which can withstand the rigors of road 
travel.
</p>
        <p><strong>Can I add air conditioning?</strong><br />
Yes, a small ceiling a/c unit can be added to keep the house cool in any climate within the US. </p>
        <h3>Trailer</h3>
        <p>This house is built on a 7' x 18' utility trailer. <a href=""http://www.bigtextrailers.com/pdf/70pi.pdf"">See spec sheet.</a>
  To learn more about utility trailers, <a href=""/blogs/tumbleweed/5929707-40-tiny-houses-in-40-days-day-34"">read this...</a>
  Here is a <a href=""/pages/trailers/#18"">list of stores</a> that sell the trailer needed to build the Lusby.</p>
        <p><strong>Do I have to build it on a trailer?</strong><br />
Because of its tiny size, it doesn’t meet the minimum size standards 
required for houses on a foundation. That said, it can be built as a 
shed (without a kitchen) on a foundation. </p>

    <h3>Cost to Build</h3>
    <p><strong>Estimated Material Costs: $24,000 (289 sq ft) or $31,000 (384 sq ft)</strong> </p>
    <p><strong>Want to know how much it will cost to have a contractor build it for you?</strong> <br />
Visit <a href=""http://www.building-cost.net/CornersType.asp"" target=""_new"">Build-Cost.net</a> and follow these <a href=""http://static.shopify.com/s/files/1/0150/9532/t/4/assets/Cost-Guide.pdf?4754"" target=""_new"">instructions</a>. </p>
    <p><em>General notes about construction costs:</em>Costs for materials 
are almost the same in different regions but labor costs will vary 
greatly depending on where you live. We provide costs with a raised 
perimeter concrete foundation. Depending on where you live, it is 
possible you will need an engineered foundation designed by a licensed 
contractor or engineer in your state.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Loft</h3>
    <p>We do not count the loft as square footage in this house because with 
so much sloped ceiling, it doesn't officially qualify as a habitable 
room. Subsequently, with seven feet of ceiling height over more than 50 
square feet, the loft provides a lot of usable space. The loft is 
accessed by a ladder in the kitchen. </p>
    <p><strong>Can I put in stairs instead of a ladder?</strong><br />
No, stairs won't fit, but ""ladder stairs"" will.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Foundation</h3>
    <p>We sell our plans with a raised perimeter foundation. However, it is 
possible to put this house on a slab foundation or even over a basement.
 However, you may need to work with an architect or engineer licensed in
 your state to get approval from the building department. </p>
    <p><strong>Can this house be built on wheels?</strong><br />
No. This small house is designed to be built on a permanent foundation.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Utilities and appliances</h3>
    <p>The kitchen includes a dishwasher, full size range with oven, and 
built in microwave. The tank-less on demand water heater ensures that 
you never run out of hot water, and tucks away completely out of view. 
An under counter washer/dryer is also included. A small fireplace is 
tucked nicely in the corner of the great room.</p>
    <p> <strong>Can I install air conditioning?</strong> <br />
Yes, you can. Our plans do not include an air conditioning unit, but you can install one in the loft or outside of the house. </p>
    <p><strong>What type of fireplace does the house have?</strong> <br />
We do not specify a particular fire place or heater because codes vary so 
much based on climate. We recommend discussing your options with a 
building contractor licensed in your state. When you build this house, <em>please</em> send us pictures. Since we do not build the house ourselves, we are dependent on you to supply us with real pictures.</p>

    <h3>New Vesica Construction Plans include 13 total pages:</h3>
    <p><strong>Floor Plans</strong><br />
Detailed floor plans for both the downstairs and loft include pertinent 
dimensions for walls, windows, rooms and door openings. You'll also 
find the location of all appliances on these plans as well.</p>
    <p><strong>Exterior Elevations</strong><br />
These plans include 4 elevation drawings showing the front, back and both sides. Siding and facia boards are called out.</p>
    <p><strong>Electric Plans</strong><br />
These pages include both the main floor and loft and show locations for outlets, light switches and lights.</p>
    <p><strong>Transverse Section</strong><br />
Perhaps one of the most important pages on any set of plans, the 
transverse section cuts the house in half and shows details such as wall
 thickness, roofing material details, flooring details, roof pitch, 
ceiling heights, and insulation.</p>
    <p><strong>Foundation Plan</strong><br />
A perimeter foundation plan is included as well with floor joists.</p>
    <p><strong>Roof Plan</strong><br />
Showing the birds-eye view of the house, you see the slopes and pitches 
clearly called out, as well as the amount of overhang, and individual 
rafter locations from above.</p>
    <p><strong>Kitchen Detail</strong><br />
Unlike many other plans on the market, we include a full kitchen plan, 
showing the location of all shelving, cabinetry and appliances as seen from 
both an aerial and frontal view. We use standard size cabinets available at 
most hardware stores.</p>
    <p><strong>Material List</strong><br />
Includes windows, doors, water heater, bath tub/shower, kitchen sink, dishwasher, range, washer/dryer and more.</p>
    <h3>What's not included</h3>
    <p><strong>Heating requirements</strong><br />
Because they vary by region we do not include these. Our plans are 
designed with a single fireplace heater. Depending on where you live, 
you may need to work with a local architect or engineer to submit plans 
that meet local requirements.</p>
    <p><strong>A cut sheet</strong><br />
Cut sheets show the quantity of lumber needed. We do suggest the types 
of materials, however the quantity of each is not included. Windows, doors, 
kitchen cabinets and appliances are included with the drawings.</p>
    <p><strong>Architect or Engineer seals</strong><br />
Some building departments require a licensed architect or engineer in 
your state to approve the plans. This often has to do with regional 
safety or energy issues,for example, hurricane safety in Florida, fire 
safety in California, energy  efficiency in New York, etc. Please 
contact your local building department to learn about the requirements 
in your area.</p>
    <h3>Other Notes:</h3>
    <p><strong>Building Codes</strong><br />
These plans have been designed to meet the International Building Code. 
Some municipalities have additional restrictions or requirements. Please
 check with your local building department to verify that these plans 
meet your local codes.</p>
    <p><strong>Square Footage</strong><br />
The square footage listed is an estimate. Unfortunately, not all 
municipalities calculate square feet in the same way. The square footage we
 list includes the bottom floor, plus the space on the top floor where 
the ceiling height is 5'0"" or taller.</p>
    <p><strong>Altering Plans</strong><br />
When you purchase a set of plans, it includes a license to build one 
house. Unfortunately, at this time, we do not offer alterations. If you 
require changes we suggest finding a local
architect or engineer who will do the alterations for you. For that 
purpose we have made the CAD and DFX files available online. With those 
files, your architect (or engineer) does not need to start from scratch; 
they can simply open the computer file and start making the adjustments 
you want.</p>
    <p>TIP: Make sure the architect or engineer you select works with 
AutoCAD (or other similar software) and is willing to work with you on 
these plans. Some professionals will
only take a job if they do it from start to finish. By carefully 
selecting someone to work with these plans, you can save thousands of 
dollars.</p>

popomo,Popomo Plans,"<h1>The Popomo</h1>
<b>1 Bedroom 172 square feet</b> <a href=""/houses/measuring-square-footage/""> <img src=""//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0150/9532/files/question2.jpg?2105"" border=""0"" /></a>
Ready made: $44,997 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build it yourself: $20,000
<p> The Popomo is sleek, simple and our easiest house to build. The hot rolled corrosion resistant steel siding separates this house from anything else on the road. At 8 feet - 6 inches wide, the Popomo maximizes the road width without requiring any special permit to tow. Weighing approximately 7500 lbs, it can be towed easily by many full sized trucks. Including the hitch, the trailer is approximately 24' long. Step inside this single level, 172 square foot house on wheels and you'll find the basic necessities:</p>

      <h3>
	Living Room</h3>
      <p>
	Once inside the Popomo you are greeted by the 3 panel sliding back door. Designed to maximize both view and solar gain, the tiny house can be made to feel amazingly large. One side of the front door is flanked by a built in closet, and the other side showcases the <a href=""/pages/heaters/"">stainless steel fireplace</a>.</p>
      <h3>Kitchen</h3>
      <p>
	<img alt="""" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-3293"" src=""//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0150/9532/files/kitchen.png?4723"" title=""kitchen"" height=""189"" width=""234"" /></p>
      <p>
	The kitchen is equipped with a small refrigerator, built in stove top, and a sink. White cabinets are offset by charcoal black counter tops. Hidden in the blind corner is a small propane water heater. The kitchen uses standard cabinet sizes that can be found at almost any hardware store.</p>
      <p>
	<strong>Can I add a dishwasher or laundry to the kitchen?</strong><br />
	In theory, you can change the layout of the kitchen to meet your needs. However, don't expect it to be easy. As you can see, there isn't too much room to play with.</p>
      <h3>Bedroom</h3>
      <p>
	The bedroom is 4'8"" wide (a little smaller than a queen mattress) and can sleep 2 people. A large piece of foam is cut and rolled up to fit through the door before being put into place. Cabinets and shelves flank both the head and foot of the bed.</p>
      <p>
	<strong>Can I add a loft?</strong><br />
	While it is possible to add a loft, this house is not intended to have a loft. Maximum road height in many states is 13'6"", and the house stands at 12'3"" without the loft. Please check your states minimum road sizes before deciding to increase the height.</p>
      <h3>Bathroom</h3>
      <p>
	Like on many boats, the bathroom is the shower ... and it is called a ""wet bath"". Using water proof truck liner paint, the walls of the bathroom are sealed tight, allowing for a quick shower. The toilet is a low flush RV toilet designed to conserve water.</p>
      <h3>Efficient and Warm</h3>
      <p>
	In addition to being affordable to build, the Popomo uses a beautiful <a href=""/pages/heaters/"">stainless steel propane fireplace</a> to warm the house, which compliments the large windows intended to face South during the winter for excellent solar gain. We've worked with HVAC engineers to insulate the house properly so that it stays warm enough, or cool enough in any climate in the continental US, the Alaskan coastline and Hawaii. The Popomo can be heated to 68 degrees in climates as cold as 35 degrees below zero (Fahrenheit). For those living outside the continental US, we've added a table showing the additional heating requirements needed ... for example in the interior of Canada and interior Alaska. Other utilities work much the same as an RV ...<br />

	Building the Popomo</h3>
      <p>
	<strong>Estimated Material Costs: $20,000</strong><br />

      <p>&nbsp;Inside, you'll find construction plans fit for a contractor, plus easier-to-read 3d illustrations for the novice builder.</p>
      <p>
	<em>T</em><em>ake away the guess work.</em> The plans show you where each framing stud goes, including shear walls and roofing.</p>
      <p>
	Most of the materials required to build this house are available at your local hardware store. Any harder to find materials are listed in our plans with information on where they may be obtained.</p>
      <p>
	<strong>How do I find a trailer?</strong><br />
	The Popomo is built on a 20' long flatbed trailer.<br />
	• You can download the spec sheet <a href=""http://www.bigtextrailers.com/pdf/12oa.pdf"">here</a>.<br />
	• <a href=""/pages/trailers/#20"">Click here</a> to see a list of vendors around the US that sell the trailer. There are many other vendors too.</p>
      <p>
	<strong>Do I have to build it on a trailer?</strong><br />
	Because of its tiny size, it doesn't meet the minimum size standards required for houses on a foundation.</p>
      <p>
	<strong>Can I use a different exterior siding other than COR-TEN steel?</strong><br />
	Yes. For example, painted board and baton siding would work just as well.</p>
      <h3>Roof</h3>
      <p>
	The roof appears to be flat, but is actually at a small slope. The rain water rolls off the back end of the house. <a name=""resources""></a></p>

    <h3>Popomo Construction Plans include 38 total pages:</h3>
    <p><strong>Floor Plans</strong><br />
Detailed floor plans for both the downstairs and loft include pertinent 
dimensions, for walls, windows, rooms and door openings. You'll also 
find the location of all appliances on these plans as well.</p>
    <p><strong>Exterior Elevations</strong><br />
These plans include 4 elevation drawings showing the front, back and both sides. Siding and facia boards are called out.</p>
    <p><strong>Electric Plans</strong><br />
These pages include both the main floor and loft and show locations for outlets, light switches and lights.</p>
    <p><strong>Transverse Section</strong><br />
Perhaps one of the most important pages on any set of plans, the 
transverse section cuts the house in half and shows details such as wall
 thickness, roofing material details, flooring details, roof pitch, 
ceiling heights, and insulation.</p>

<strong>Foundation Plan</strong><br />
Built on a trailer, the plans describe which trailer to buy, and how to 
attach to the house. Also included is the floor framing, showing the 
exact location of each joist and calling out pressure treated joists as 
needed.

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Framing Plans</strong><br />
These plans show the framing for all 4 walls, laying out the exact location of each stud.</p>
    <p><strong>Roof Plan</strong><br />
Showing the birds-eye view of the house, you see the slopes and pitches 
clearly called out and individual rafter locations from above.</p>
    <p><strong>Kitchen and Cabinet Detail</strong><br />
Unlike other many plans on the market, we include elevation plans for 
cabinets and kitchen counters (giving you the ability to see them from 
the top and from the front).</p>
    <p><strong>3-d Building Steps</strong><br />
This plan includes step-by-step 3d framing diagrams for each interior and exterior wall.</p>
    <p>

<strong>Material List</strong><br />
Includes windows, doors, water heater, bath tub/shower, kitchen sink, dishwasher, range, washer/dryer and more.</p>
    <h3>What's not included</h3>
    <p><b>Electric or Plumbing Isometrics</b><br />
The plans show the location of outlets, lights, and fixtures, but do not
 include plans showing the location of pipes and wires inside the wall. 
Also, plans do not suggest types of wiring or plumbing pipes to use. We 
suggest working with a licensed electrician and plumber to make sure 
your house meets your specific needs.</p>
    <p><b>Architect or Engineer seals</b><br />
Some building departments require a licensed architect or engineer in 
your state to approve the plans. This often has to do with regional 
safety or energy issues,for example, hurricane safety in Florida, fire 
safety in California, energy efficiency in New York, etc. Please contact
 your local building department to learn about the requirements in your 
area.</p>
    <h3>Other Notes:</h3>
    <p><b>Building Codes</b><br />
In most municipalities this house can not be built on a permanent 
foundation. Please check with your zoning department to make sure you 
can live in a mobile structure on your property.</p>
    <p><b>Square Footage</b><br />
The square footage listed is an estimate. The square footage we list 
includes the bottom floor. It does not include the loft or porch.</p>
    <p><b>Altering Plans</b><br />
When you purchase a set of plans, it includes a license to build one 
house. Unfortunately, at this time, we don't offer alterations. We spend
 approximately 250-500 hours on these plans, and the details are 
incredibly specific. Alterations can easily run into thousands of 
dollars since one little change affects so many things.</p>

<p>The Sebastarosa is one of our largest homes. It can be built as a 2 
(750 sq ft) or 3 (847 sq ft) bedroom house. The 3rd bedroom is an 
optional add-on that is on the first floor level. The top floor houses 
two additional bedrooms. Each story of the house is 7'6"" tall at its 
peak. The upstairs bedrooms have sloped ceilings on the sides, and the 
closets are positioned in the lower ceiling space. The exterior height 
of the Sebastarosa is 21'. This house is not designed to be portable. We
 sell the <a href=""#cart"">plans</a> to build it on location.</p>

    <h3>Cost to Build</h3>
    <p><strong>Estimated Material Costs: $49,000 (750 sq ft) or $56,000 (847 sq ft)</strong> </p>
    <p><strong>Want to know how much it will cost to have a contractor build it for you?</strong> <br />
Visit <a href=""http://www.building-cost.net/CornersType.asp"" target=""_new"">Build-Cost.net</a> and follow these <a href=""http://static.shopify.com/s/files/1/0150/9532/t/4/assets/Cost-Guide.pdf?4754"" target=""_new"">instructions</a>. </p>
    <p><em>General notes about construction costs:</em>Costs for materials 
are almost the same in different regions but labor costs will vary 
greatly depending on where you live. We provide costs with a raised 
perimeter concrete foundation. Depending on where you live, it is 
possible you will need an engineered foundation designed by a licensed 
contractor or engineer in your state.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Foundation</h3>
    <p>The house plans come with a post and pier foundation. However, it is 
possible to put this house on a slab foundation or even over a basement.
 You may need to work with an architect or engineer licensed in your 
state to get approval from the building department. </p>
    <p><strong>Can this house be built on wheels?</strong><br />
No. This small house is designed to be built on a permanent foundation.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Utilities and appliances</h3>
    <p>The kitchen maximizes space and includes a dishwasher, full size 
range with oven, and built in microwave. The tank-less on demand water 
heater ensures that you never run out of hot water, and tucks away 
completely out of view. A stacking washer and dryer flank the kitchen. A
 small fireplace is tucked nicely in the corner of the great room. </p>
    <p><strong>Can I install air conditioning?</strong> <br />
Our plans do not include an air conditioning unit, however you can install one. </p>
    <p><strong>What type of fireplace does the house have?</strong> <br />
We do not specify a particular fire place or heater because codes vary so 
much based on climate. We recommend discussing your options with a 
building contractor licensed in your state. When you build this house, <em>please</em> send us pictures. Since we do not build the house ourselves, we are dependent on you to supply us with real pictures.</p>

    <h3>Sebastarosa Construction Plans include 13 total pages:</h3>
    <p><strong>Floor Plans</strong><br />
Detailed floor plans for both the downstairs and loft include pertinent 
dimensions for walls, windows, rooms and door openings. You'll also 
find the location of all appliances on these plans as well.</p>
    <p><strong>Exterior Elevations</strong><br />
These plans include 4 elevation drawings showing the front, back and both sides. Siding and facia boards are called out.</p>
    <p><strong>Electric Plans</strong><br />
These pages include both the main floor and loft and show locations for outlets, light switches and lights.</p>
    <p><strong>Transverse Section</strong><br />
Perhaps one of the most important pages on any set of plans, the 
transverse section cuts the house in half and shows details such as wall
 thickness, roofing material details, flooring details, roof pitch, 
ceiling heights, and insulation.</p>

<strong>Foundation Plan</strong><br />
A perimeter foundation plan is included as well with floor joists.

  
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Roof Plan</strong><br />
Showing the birds-eye view of the house, you see the slopes and pitches 
clearly called out, as well as the amount of overhang, and individual 
rafter locations from above.</p>
    <p><strong>Kitchen Detail</strong><br />
Unlike many other plans on the market, we include a full kitchen plan showing the location of all shelving, cabinetry and appliances as seen from 
both an aerial and frontal view. We use standard size cabinets available at 
most hardware stores.</p>

<strong>Material List</strong><br />
Includes windows, doors, water heater, bath tub/shower, kitchen sink, dishwasher, range, washer/dryer and more.

  
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <h3>What's not included</h3>
    <p><b>Heating requirements</b><br />Because they vary by region we do not 
include these. Our plans are designed with a single fireplace heater. 
Depending on where you live, you may need to work with a local architect
 or engineer to submit plans that meet local requirements.</p>
    <p><b>A cut sheet</b><br />Cut sheets show the quantity of lumber needed.
 We do suggest the types of materials, however the quantity of each is not 
included. Windows, doors, kitchen cabinets and appliances are included 
with the drawings.</p>
    <p><b>Architect or Engineer seals</b><br />Some building departments 
require a licensed architect or engineer in your state to approve the 
plans. This often has to do with regional safety or energy issues,for 
example, hurricane safety in Florida, fire safety in California, energy 
 efficiency in New York, etc. Please contact your local building 
department to learn about the requirements in your area.</p>
    <h3>Other Notes:</h3>
    <p><b>Building Codes</b><br />These plans have been designed to meet the 
International Building Code. Some municipalities have additional 
restrictions or requirements. Please check with your local building 
department to verify that these plans meet your local codes.</p>
    <p><b>Square Footage</b><br />The square footage listed is an estimate. 
Unfortunately, not all municipalities calculate square feet in the same 
way. The square footage we list includes the bottom floor, plus the 
space on the top floor where the ceiling height is 5'0"" or taller.</p>
    <p><b>Altering Plans</b><br />
When you purchase a set of plans, it includes a license to build one 
house. Unfortunately, at this time, we do not offer alterations. If you 
require changes we suggest finding a local
architect or engineer who will do the alterations for you. For that 
purpose we have made the CAD and DFX files available online. With those 
files, your architect (or engineer) does not need to start from scratch; 
they can simply open the computer file and start making the adjustments 
you want.</p>
    <p>
</p>
    <p>TIP: Make sure the architect or engineer you select works with 
AutoCAD (or other similar software) and is willing to work with you on 
these plans. Some professionals will
only take a job if they do it from start to finish. By carefully 
selecting someone to work with these plans, you can save thousands of 
dollars.</p>

    <h3>About the Box Bungalow models</h3>
    <p>Undue expense and red tape have been cut to keep the Box Bungalows 
user friendly and affordable. Most municipalities mandate that a permit 
is not required to put a building of less than 120 square feet on your 
property, though you'd want to check with your local building and zoning
 departments to be sure. While you're at it, see if there are any 
setback requirements that govern where a structure can be set or how it 
can officially be used.</p>
    <p>Our plans include a foundation on concrete footings, but the foundation choices are limitless.</p>
    <h3>Finishing the interior</h3>
    <p>Once you've got a shell, the interior fittings and finishes are 
entirely up to you. It can be used as a backyard bedroom, office, yoga 
retreat, or artist studio.</p>
    <p>A sleeping loft can be set on the collar ties overhead with ease, or 
you may choose to put a bed down stairs. You can also consider a Murphy 
bed or other foldaway furniture. Including a lot of storage is a great 
way to open up the area as much as possible for a sense of volume. 
Built-ins are also a great way to maximize space.</p>
    <div id=""first"" style=""display: block;""></div>


Pictured above are 5 unique examples of how the interior can be laid out. The options are limitless.

      <h3>Stamper Plans include 19 total pages:</h3>
      <p><strong>Floor Plans</strong><br />
    Floor plans for both the main floor and optional loft includes pertinent dimensions for walls, the door, and optional windows.</p>
      <p><strong>Exterior Elevations</strong><br />
    These plans include 4 elevation drawings showing the front, back and both sides. Siding and facia boards are called out.</p>
      <p><strong>Electric Plans</strong><br />
    These pages include both the main floor and loft and show locations for outlets, light switches and lights.</p>
      <p><strong>Transverse Section</strong><br />
    Perhaps one of the most important pages on any set of plans, the  transverse section cuts the house in half and shows details such as wall  thickness, roofing material details, flooring details, roof pitch,  ceiling heights, and insulation.</p>
      <p><strong>Foundation Plan</strong><br />
    We include plans for poured pier or concrete block foundation, but this  house may also be placed on a slab or other appropriate foundation.  Floor framing for all the joists are also included, calling out treated  lumber as needed.</p>
      <p><strong>Framing Plans</strong><br />
    These plans show the framing for all 4 walls, both gables and lay out the exact location of each stud.</p>
      <p><strong>Roof Plan</strong><br />
    Showing the birds-eye view of the house, you see the slopes and pitches  clearly called out, as well as the amount of overhang, and individual  rafter locations from above for both the roof and porch. Also included  is the sheething plan for the roof which is designed so that soffits  aren't needed. </p>
      <p><strong>Door Detail</strong><br />
    The front door to this home is custom made from standard materials. We include plans to build the door.</p>
      <h3>What's not included</h3>
      <p><strong>Interior Details</strong><br />
    These homes are designed to be customized by you inside. These plans do not include any interior details.</p>
      <p><strong>Electric or Plumbing</strong><br />
    These plans do not include electric or plumbing. We suggest working with  a licensed electrician and plumber to make sure your house meets your  specific needs.</p>
      <p><strong>Architect or Engineer seals</strong><br />
    Some building departments require a licensed architect or engineer in  your state to approve any structure. Please consult your building  department.</p>
      <p><strong>Material List</strong><br />
    The plans do call out types of finish material and list specific window  sizes, however a material list showing framing materials and quantities  is not included.</p>
      <h3>Other Notes:</h3>
      <p><strong>Building Codes</strong><br />
    In many municipalities the Box Bungalow meets the codes for a shed.  Please consult your local building department to determine if this  structure can be used for your intended use.</p>
      <p><strong>Square Footage</strong><br />
    The square footage listed is an estimate. The square footage we list  includes the bottom floor. It does not include the loft or porch.</p>
      <p><strong>Altering Plans</strong><br />
    When you purchase a set of plans, it includes a license to build one  structure. Unfortunately, at this time, we don't offer alterations. We  spend approximately hundreds of hours on our plans, and the details are  incredibly specific. Alterations can easily run into thousands of  dollars since one little change affects so many things.</p>

  <p>The great room has vaulted ceilings which are accented by the pine 
interior finishing. Stainless steel counters show off the kitchen, and 
the bathroom has a full shower. The sleeping loft is upstairs and 
accessible by a ladder. It is shown above with the optional corrugated 
metal siding. However, it can be built with the standard cedar 
clapboard, or board and baton siding. The roof is covered with standing 
seam metal roofing.&nbsp;</p>

      <h3>Living Room</h3>
The Tarleton has an open ceiling and a <a href=""/pages/heaters/"">stainless steel fireplace</a>.
 The open ceiling above makes the space feel very roomy. The entry to 
the living room is flanked by two full size closets perfect for storing 
clothes.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
      
      <h3> </h3>
      <h3>Kitchen</h3>
One of our largest kitchens; it comes with a sink, 2 burner stove top, 
refrigerator, and ample shelving. Below the sink, there is a small water
 heater. There is enough space that you can choose between a small 
toaster oven, microwave, washer/dryer, or dishwasher if you choose.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
      
      <h3> </h3>
      <h3>Bedroom</h3>
The bedroom is in the loft. It is large enough to fit a queen size bed, 
but that said, this house is a little small for 2 people. Because of the
 open loft, you can fit a conventional mattress above. At its peak, the 
loft height is 3'-8"".
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
      
      <h3> </h3>
      <h3>Bathroom</h3>
The bathroom has both a toilet and a separate shower. The shower water 
is heated from the small water heater under the kitchen sink, and can 
last about 5 minutes. It doesn't come with a hand sink, but it is 
possible to install a hand sink above the toilet as is common in Japan.

The toilet is a low flush RV toilet designed to conserve water. You can 
easily substitute a composting toilet.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
      
      <h3> </h3>
      <h3>Efficient and Warm</h3>
      <p>The Tarleton features a <a href=""/pages/heaters/"">stainless steel fireplace</a>
 which keeps this house warm in temperatures -35 F. Because of its small
 size, its 16R insulation is sufficient to keep this house warm in the 
harshest of climates of the continental US and Southern Canada. Heading 
north of Southern Canada? You can easily install a larger heater, or 
second heater. All four walls, the floor and the roof are insulated 
using polystyrene foam board which can withstand the rigors of road 
travel.
</p>
      <p><strong>Can I add air conditioning?</strong><br />
Yes, a small ceiling a/c unit can be added to keep the house cool in any climate within the US. </p>
      <h3> </h3>
      <h3>Trailer</h3>
      <p>This house is built on a 7' x 18' utility trailer. <a href=""http://www.bigtextrailers.com/pdf/70pi.pdf"">See spec sheet.</a>
  To learn more about utility trailers, <a href=""/blogs/tumbleweed/5912813-trailers"">read this...</a>
  Here is a <a href=""/pages/trailers/#18"">list of stores</a> that sell the trailer needed to build the Tarleton.
</p>
      <p><strong>Do I have to build it on a trailer?</strong><br />
Because of its tiny size, it doesn’t meet the minimum size standards 
required for houses on a foundation. That said, it can be built as a 
shed (without a kitchen) on a foundation. </p>

vardo,Vardo Plans,"<h3>The Vardo</h3>
<p>The Vardo is designed to nest inside most truck beds. It can also 
be pulled on its own trailer. The material costs to build this structure
 are approximately $2,500 (not including the optional heater).</p>
<p>It has enough room for a full-sized bed flanked by a couple of work surfaces. Underneath is 35 cubic feet of storage space.</p>
<p>The Vardo is not designed as a “house”. It doesn’t have a kitchen or bathroom.</p>
<p>We built the first model utilizing a recycled stained glass window in the front door.</p>
<p>A heater can be added to warm your cabin on cold nights.
</p>
<p><strong>Can I add air conditioning?</strong><br />
 Yes, a small ceiling a/c unit can be added to keep the house cool in any climate within the US.</p>
<p><strong>What type of truck can I build this in?</strong><br /> These 
plans are designed with the most popular Ford 150 truck in mind. 
However, you can easily build it longer or shorter as needed to meet the
 requirements of your truck.</p>

  <p>The great room has vaulted ceilings which are accented by the pine 
interior finishing. Stainless steel counters show off the kitchen, and 
the bathroom has a full shower. The sleeping loft is upstairs and 
accessible by a ladder. It is shown above with the optional corrugated 
metal siding. However, it can be built with the standard cedar 
clapboard, or board and baton siding. The roof is covered with standing 
seam metal roofing.&nbsp;</p>

      <h3>Living Room</h3>
The has an open ceiling and a <a href=""/pages/heaters/"">stainless steel fireplace</a>.
 The open ceiling above makes the space feel very roomy. <span>The four windows that surround the living room make this space very bright.</span>
      <h3> </h3>
      <h3>Kitchen</h3>
One of our largest kitchens; it comes with a sink, 2 burner stove top, 
refrigerator, and ample shelving. Below the sink, there is a small water
 heater. There is enough space that you can choose between a small 
toaster oven, microwave, washer/dryer, or dishwasher if you choose.
    
      
      
      <h3> </h3>
      <h3>Bedroom</h3>
The bedroom is in the loft. It is large enough to fit a queen size bed, 
but that said, this house is a little small for 2 people. Because of the
 open loft, you can fit a conventional mattress above. At its peak, the 
loft height is 3'-8"".
    
   
      
      
      <h3> </h3>
      <h3>Bathroom</h3>
The bathroom has both a toilet and a separate shower. The shower water 
is heated from the small water heater under the kitchen sink, and can 
last about 5 minutes. It doesn't come with a hand sink, but it is 
possible to install a hand sink above the toilet as is common in Japan.

The toilet is a low flush RV toilet designed to conserve water. You can 
easily substitute a composting toilet.
    
    
      
      <h3> </h3>
      <h3>Efficient and Warm</h3>
      <p>The Walden features a <a href=""/pages/heaters/"">stainless steel fireplace</a>
 which keeps this house warm in temperatures -35 F. Because of its small
 size, its 16R insulation is sufficient to keep this house warm in the 
harshest of climates of the continental US and Southern Canada. Heading 
north of Southern Canada? You can easily install a larger heater, or 
second heater. All four walls, the floor and the roof are insulated 
using polystyrene foam board which can withstand the rigors of road 
travel.
</p>
      <p><strong>Can I add air conditioning?</strong><br />
Yes, a small ceiling a/c unit can be added to keep the house cool in any climate within the US. </p>
      <h3> </h3>
      <h3>Trailer</h3>
      <p>This house is built on a 7' x 18' utility trailer. <a href=""http://www.bigtextrailers.com/pdf/70pi.pdf"">See spec sheet.</a>
  To learn more about utility trailers, <a href=""/blogs/tumbleweed/5929707-40-tiny-houses-in-40-days-day-34"">read this...</a>
  Here is a <a href=""/pages/trailers/#18"">list of stores</a> that sell the trailer needed to build the Walden.
</p>
      <p><strong>Do I have to build it on a trailer?</strong><br />
Because of its tiny size, it doesn’t meet the minimum size standards 
required for houses on a foundation. That said, it can be built as a 
shed (without a kitchen) on a foundation. </p>

We spend approximately 250-500 hours on these plans, and the details are incredibly specific. Alterations can easily run into thousands of dollars since one little change affects so many things.

    <p>The Weebee boasts the wonderful bump-out windows in the front. The 
interior is completely finished in pine with stainless steel counters. 
The exterior of this house is finished with cedar plank siding and a corrugated aluminum roof. Yes, when it rains, you can hear it. The 
Weebee can also be finished with board and batten siding or corrugated 
aluminum.&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>Living Room</h3>
The ""living room"" is flooded with light from all of the windows surrounding the front of the house. The <a href=""/pages/heaters/"">stainless steel fireplace</a> warms the house amazingly well. The nook is large enough to store a day bed, futon, or small couch.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
      
      
      
        
        
        
        <h3>Kitchen</h3>
        <p>The kitchen features a sink, 2 burner stove top, refrigerator, and 
ample shelving. Below the sink, there is a small water heater, and the 
refrigerator. There is also space where you can store a small toaster 
oven or microwave if you choose. </p>
        <p><strong>Can I add a dishwasher or laundry to the kitchen?</strong><br />
The kitchen is too small, but a washer/dryer combo can be placed in the lower half of the closet (back left of living room). </p>
        <h3>Bedroom</h3>
The bedroom is in the loft. It is large enough to fit a queen size bed, 
but that said, this house is a little small for 2 people. The mattress 
is foam (or like kind) so that it can be rolled up and fit through the 
loft opening. The loft also has shelving for clothing. At its peak, the 
loft height is 3'-8"".
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
      
      
      
        
        
        
        <h3>Bathroom</h3>
        <p>Like on many boats, the bathroom is the shower … and it is called a 
""wet bath"". We use metal diamond plate finishing on the walls that leave
 it with a modern look. The shower water is heated from the small water 
heater under the kitchen sink, and can last about 5 minutes.  </p>
        <p>The toilet is a low flush RV toilet designed to conserve water. You can easily substitute a composting toilet. </p>
        <h3>Efficient and Warm</h3>
        <p>The Weebee features a <a href=""/pages/heaters/"">stainless steel fireplace</a>
 which keeps this house warm in temperatures -35 F. Because of its small
 size, its 16R insulation is sufficient to keep this house warm in the 
harshest of climates. By increasing the heater size to the Dickinson 
P-12000, the house can stay warm anywhere in Canada and Alaska. All four
 walls, the floor and the roof are insulated using polystyrene foam 
board which can withstand the rigors of road travel.
</p>
        <p><strong>Can I add air conditioning?</strong><br />
Yes, a small ceiling a/c unit can be added to keep the house cool in any climate within the US. </p>
        <h3>Trailer</h3>
        <p>This house is built on a 7' x 14' utility trailer. <a href=""http://www.bigtextrailers.com/pdf/70pi.pdf"">See spec sheet.</a>
  To learn more about utility trailers, <a href=""/blogs/tumbleweed/5912813-trailers"">read this...</a>
  Here is a <a href=""/pages/trailers/#14"">list of stores</a> that sell the trailer needed to build the Weebee.</p>
        <p><strong>Do I have to build it on a trailer?</strong><br />
  Because of its tiny size, it doesn't meet the minimum size standards 
required for houses on a foundation. That said, it can be built as a 
shed (without a kitchen) on a foundation.

We spend approximately 250-500 hours on these plans, and the details are incredibly specific. Alterations can easily run into thousands of dollars since one little change affects so many things.

    <h3>About the Box Bungalow models</h3>
    <p>Undue expense and red tape have been cut to keep the Box Bungalows 
user friendly and affordable. Most municipalities mandate that a permit 
is not required to put a building of less than 120 square feet on your 
property, though you'd want to check with your local building and zoning
 departments to be sure. While you're at it, see if there are any 
setback requirements that govern where a structure can be set or how it 
can officially be used.</p>
    <p>Our plans include a foundation on concrete footings, but the foundation choices are limitless.</p>
    <h3>Finishing the interior</h3>
    <p>Once you've got a shell, the interior fittings and finishes are 
entirely up to you. It can be used as a backyard bedroom, office, yoga 
retreat, or artist studio.</p>
    <p>A sleeping loft can be set on the collar ties overhead with ease, or 
you may choose to put a bed down stairs. You can also consider a Murphy 
bed or other foldaway furniture. Including a lot of storage is a great 
way to open up the area as much as possible for a sense of volume. 
Built-ins are also a great way to maximize space.</p>
    <div id=""first"" style=""display: block;""></div>


Pictured above are 5 unique examples of how the interior can be laid out. The options are limitless.

    <p>
	<strong>Kit House</strong></p>
    <p>
	Our Box Bungalow flat-pack can be assembled by two or three people in a weekend, then painted and accessorized as desired. The base kit includes the floor, roof, walls, and door. It comes in approximately 15 pieces. The walls are unfinished, and would need to be insulated, finished, and painted by you.</p>
    <p>
	<strong>Fully Assembled</strong></p>
    <p>
	You can choose your options, and we'll build and assemble it for you. Once complete, it is delivered to you.</p>

    Floor plans for both the main floor and optional loft includes pertinent dimensions for walls, the door, and optional windows.</p>
      <p><strong>Exterior Elevations</strong><br />
    These plans include 4 elevation drawings showing the front, back and both sides. Siding and facia boards are called out.</p>
      <p><strong>Electric Plans</strong><br />
    These pages include both the main floor and loft and show locations for outlets, light switches and lights.</p>
      <p><strong>Transverse Section</strong><br />
    Perhaps one of the most important pages on any set of plans, the  transverse section cuts the house in half and shows details such as wall  thickness, roofing material details, flooring details, roof pitch,  ceiling heights, and insulation.</p>
      <p><strong>Foundation Plan</strong><br />
    We include plans for poured pier or concrete block foundation, but this  house may also be placed on a slab or other appropriate foundation.  Floor framing for all the joists are also included, calling out treated  lumber as needed.</p>
      <p><strong>Framing Plans</strong><br />
    These plans show the framing for all 4 walls, both gables and lay out the exact location of each stud.</p>
      <p><strong>Roof Plan</strong><br />
    Showing the birds-eye view of the house, you see the slopes and pitches  clearly called out, as well as the amount of overhang, and individual  rafter locations from above for both the roof and porch. Also included  is the sheething plan for the roof which is designed so that soffits  aren't needed. </p>
      <p><strong>Door Detail</strong><br />
    The front door to this home is custom made from standard materials. We include plans to build the door.</p>
      <h3>What's not included</h3>
      <p><strong>Interior Details</strong><br />
    These homes are designed to be customized by you inside. These plans do not include any interior details.</p>
      <p><strong>Electric or Plumbing</strong><br />
    These plans do not include electric or plumbing. We suggest working with  a licensed electrician and plumber to make sure your house meets your  specific needs.</p>
      <p><strong>Architect or Engineer seals</strong><br />
    Some building departments require a licensed architect or engineer in  your state to approve any structure. Please consult your building  department.</p>
      <p><strong>Material List</strong><br />
    The plans do call out types of finish material and list specific window  sizes, however a material list showing framing materials and quantities  is not included.</p>
      <h3>Other Notes:</h3>
      <p><strong>Building Codes</strong><br />
    In many municipalities the Box Bungalow meets the codes for a shed.  Please consult your local building department to determine if this  structure can be used for your intended use.</p>
      <p><strong>Square Footage</strong><br />
    The square footage listed is an estimate. The square footage we list  includes the bottom floor. It does not include the loft or porch.</p>
      <p><strong>Altering Plans</strong><br />
    When you purchase a set of plans, it includes a license to build one  structure. Unfortunately, at this time, we don't offer alterations. We  spend approximately hundreds of hours on our plans, and the details are  incredibly specific. Alterations can easily run into thousands of  dollars since one little change affects so many things.</p>

  <p>The Whidbey is designed as a single story house with the choice of 1 
or 2 downstairs bedrooms. Its simple design makes the house affordable 
to build, and full of light. The bedrooms have ample closet space, and 
the house makes use of its pitched roof for additional storage space or 
whatever else you choose to use it for. I do not list the upstairs 
square footage because, with so much sloped ceiling, it does not 
officially qualify as a habitable room. The house is 17' 6"" tall.</p>

    <h3>Cost to Build</h3>
    <p><strong>Estimated Material Costs: $35,000 (461 sq ft) or $41,500 (557 sq ft)</strong> </p>
    <p><strong>Want to know how much it will cost to have a contractor build it for you?</strong> <br />
Visit <a href=""http://www.building-cost.net/CornersType.asp"" target=""_new"">Build-Cost.net</a> and follow these <a href=""http://static.shopify.com/s/files/1/0150/9532/t/4/assets/Cost-Guide.pdf?4754"" target=""_new"">instructions</a>. <em>General notes about construction costs:</em>Costs
 for materials are almost the same in different regions but labor costs 
will vary greatly depending on where you live. We provide costs with a 
concrete poured perimeter foundation. Depending on where you live, it is
 possible you will need an engineered foundation designed by a licensed 
contractor or engineer in your state.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Loft</h3>
    <p>We do not count the loft as square footage in this house because with 
so much sloped ceiling, it does not officially qualify as a habitable 
room. Subsequently, the loft is 6'8"" tall over much of its space. The loft 
is accessed by a <a href=""http://www.easy2diy.com/cm/easy/diy_ht_index.asp?page_id=35720153"">drop down stair ladder</a>.
 The plans come with two options for the loft: Option 1: A full loft 
over the kitchen, bathroom, living room and front bedroom. The stair 
ladder is located in the kitchen. Option 2: Two lofts are split by a 
cathedral ceiling over the living room, and the lofts have a railing 
making the living room open. There are two stair ladders, one for each 
loft located in the kitchen and front bedroom. </p>
    <p><strong>Can I put in stairs instead of a stair ladder?</strong> <br />
Stairs will not fit in this design. </p>
    <p><strong>Why does the picture in <a href=""/pages/books/"">The Small House Book</a> show a staircase?</strong><br />
Originally, the sleeping area was in the loft, but to improve the design
 the stairwell was removed. This allowed the living area to become much 
larger, and the bedroom was moved downstairs. Meanwhile, no space was 
lost in the loft area.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Foundation</h3>
    <p>We sell our plans with a poured perimeter foundation. However, it is 
possible to put this house on a slab foundation or even over a basement.
 However, you may need to work with an architect or engineer licensed in
 your state to get approval from the building department. </p>
    <p><strong>Can this house be built on wheels?<br />
</strong>No. This house is designed to be built on a permanent foundation.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Utilities and appliances</h3>
    <p>The kitchen maximizes space and includes a dishwasher, full size 
range with oven, and built in microwave. The tank-less on demand water 
heater ensures that you never run out of hot water, and tucks away 
completely out of view. A small fireplace is tucked nicely in the corner
 of the great room. The one bedroom house features a washer/dryer closet
 just off of the kitchen. The two bedroom house has an under counter 
washer/dryer in the kitchen. You can choose to convert the closet in the
 back bedroom near the shower into a washer/dryer closet. </p>
    <p><strong>Can I install air conditioning?</strong> <br />
Yes, you can. Our plans do not include an air conditioning unit, but you can install one in the loft or outside of the house. </p>
    <p><strong>What type of fireplace does the house have?</strong><br />
We don't specify a particular fire place or heater because codes vary so 
much based on climate. We recommend discussing your options with a 
building contractor licensed in your state.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Building this house</h3>
    <p>We sell the construction plans to build this house. It is designed to
 be built on site. This house is not designed to be on wheels. We 
recommend working with a licensed contractor in your state to build the 
house. When you build this house, <em>please</em> send us pictures. Since we do not build the house ourselves, we are dependent on you to supply us with real pictures.</p>

A perimeter foundation plan is included as well with floor joists.

          
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Roof Plan</strong><br />
Showing the birds-eye view of the house, you see the slopes and pitches 
clearly called out, as well as the amount of overhang, and individual 
rafter locations from above.</p>
    <p><strong>Kitchen Detail</strong><br />
Unlike many other plans on the market, we include a full kitchen plan showing location of all shelving, cabinetry and appliances as seen from 
both an aerial and frontal view. We use standard size cabinets available at 
most hardware stores.</p>

<strong>Material List</strong><br />
Includes windows, doors, water heater, bath tub/shower, kitchen sink, dishwasher, range, washer/dryer and more.

          
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <h3>What's not included</h3>
    <p><b>Heating requirements</b><br />Because they vary by region we do not 
include these. Our plans are designed with a single fireplace heater. 
Depending on where you live, you may need to work with a local architect
 or engineer to submit plans that meet local requirements.</p>
    <p><b>A cut sheet</b><br />Cut sheets show the quantity of lumber needed.
 We do suggest the types of materials, however the quantity of each is not 
included. Windows, doors, kitchen cabinets and appliances are included 
with the drawings.</p>
    <p><b>Architect or Engineer seals</b><br />Some building departments 
require a licensed architect or engineer in your state to approve the 
plans. This often has to do with regional safety or energy issues,for 
example, hurricane safety in Florida, fire safety in California, energy 
 efficiency in New York, etc. Please contact your local building 
department to learn about the requirements in your area.</p>
    <h3>Other Notes:</h3>
    <p><b>Building Codes</b><br />These plans have been designed to meet the 
International Building Code. Some municipalities have additional 
restrictions or requirements. Please check with your local building 
department to verify that these plans meet your local codes.</p>
    <p><b>Square Footage</b><br />The square footage listed is an estimate. 
Unfortunately, not all municipalities calculate square feet in the same 
way. The square footage we list includes the bottom floor, plus the 
space on the top floor where the ceiling height is 5'0"" or taller.</p>
    <p><b>Altering Plans</b><br />
When you purchase a set of plans, it includes a license to build one 
house. Unfortunately, at this time, we do not offer alterations. If you 
require changes we suggest finding a local
architect or engineer who will do the alterations for you. For that 
purpose we have made the CAD and DFX files available online. With those 
files, your architect (or engineer) does not need to start from scratch; 
they can simply open the computer file and start making the adjustments 
you want.</p>
    <p>
</p>
    <p>TIP: Make sure the architect or engineer you select works with 
AutoCAD (or other similar software) and is willing to work with you on 
these plans. Some professionals will
only take a job if they do it from start to finish. By carefully 
selecting someone to work with these plans, you can save thousands of 
dollars.</p>

<p>Lindsey Lewis of Little Rock, AR built the home pictured above. You can read her story from ""<a href=""http://www.athomearkansas.com/article/little-house-little-rock"">At Home in Arkansas</a>""</p>

    <h3>Cost to Build</h3>
    <p><strong>Estimated Material Costs: $35,000 (461 sq ft) or $41,500 (557 sq ft)</strong> </p>
    <p><strong>Want to know how much it will cost to have a contractor build it for you?</strong> <br />
Visit <a href=""http://www.building-cost.net/CornersType.asp"" target=""_new"">Build-Cost.net</a> and follow these <a href=""http://static.shopify.com/s/files/1/0150/9532/t/4/assets/Cost-Guide.pdf?4754"" target=""_new"">instructions</a>. <em>General notes about construction costs:</em>Costs
 for materials are almost the same in different regions but labor costs 
will vary greatly depending on where you live. We provide costs with a 
concrete poured perimeter foundation. Depending on where you live, it is
 possible you will need an engineered foundation designed by a licensed 
contractor or engineer in your state.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Loft</h3>
    <p>We do not count the loft as square footage in this house because with 
so much sloped ceiling, it does not officially qualify as a habitable 
room. Subsequently, the loft is 6'8"" tall over much of its space. The loft 
is accessed by a <a href=""http://www.easy2diy.com/cm/easy/diy_ht_index.asp?page_id=35720153"">drop down stair ladder</a>.
 The plans come with two options for the loft: Option 1: A full loft 
over the kitchen, bathroom, living room and front bedroom. The stair 
ladder is located in the kitchen. Option 2: Two lofts are split by a 
cathedral ceiling over the living room, and the lofts have a railing 
making the living room open. There are two stair ladders, one for each 
loft located in the kitchen and front bedroom. </p>
    <p><strong>Can I put in stairs instead of a stair ladder?</strong> <br />
Stairs will not fit in this design. </p>
    <p><strong>Why does the picture in <a href=""/pages/books/"">The Small House Book</a> show a staircase?</strong><br />
Originally, the sleeping area was in the loft, but to improve the design
 the stairwell was removed. This allowed the living area to become much 
larger, and the bedroom was moved downstairs. Meanwhile, no space was 
lost in the loft area.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Foundation</h3>
    <p>We sell our plans with a poured perimeter foundation. However, it is 
possible to put this house on a slab foundation or even over a basement.
 However, you may need to work with an architect or engineer licensed in
 your state to get approval from the building department. </p>
    <p><strong>Can this house be built on wheels?<br />
</strong>No. This house is designed to be built on a permanent foundation.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Utilities and appliances</h3>
    <p>The kitchen maximizes space and includes a dishwasher, full size 
range with oven, and built in microwave. The tank-less on demand water 
heater ensures that you never run out of hot water, and tucks away 
completely out of view. A small fireplace is tucked nicely in the corner
 of the great room. The one bedroom house features a washer/dryer closet
 just off of the kitchen. The two bedroom house has an under counter 
washer/dryer in the kitchen. You can choose to convert the closet in the
 back bedroom near the shower into a washer/dryer closet. </p>
    <p><strong>Can I install air conditioning?</strong> <br />
Yes, you can. Our plans do not include an air conditioning unit, but you can install one in the loft or outside of the house. </p>
    <p><strong>What type of fireplace does the house have?</strong><br />
We don't specify a particular fire place or heater because codes vary so 
much based on climate. We recommend discussing your options with a 
building contractor licensed in your state.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Building this house</h3>
    <p>We sell the construction plans to build this house. It is designed to
 be built on site. This house is not designed to be on wheels. We 
recommend working with a licensed contractor in your state to build the 
house. When you build this house, <em>please</em> send us pictures. Since we do not build the house ourselves, we are dependent on you to supply us with real pictures.</p>

    <h3>Whidbey Construction Plans include 13 total pages:</h3>
    <p>When you purchase these plans, you will receive 2 sets:<br />
	</p>
    <li>A complete set of plans with a cathedral ceiling over the main room</li>
    <li>A complete set of plans with a full loft over the main room</li>
    <p><strong>Floor Plans</strong><br />
Detailed floor plans for both the downstairs and loft include pertinent 
dimensions for walls, windows, rooms and door openings. You'll also 
find the location of all appliances on these plans as well. Two loft 
plans are provided giving you an option of a cathedral ceiling over the 
main room, or extra loft space above.</p>
    <p><strong>Exterior Elevations</strong><br />
These plans include 4 elevation drawings showing the front, back and both sides. Siding and facia boards are called out.</p>
    <p><strong>Electric Plans</strong><br />
These pages include both the main floor and loft and show locations for outlets, light switches and lights.</p>
    <p><strong>Transverse Section</strong><br />
Perhaps one of the most important pages on any set of plans, the 
transverse section cuts the house in half and shows details such as wall
 thickness, roofing material details, flooring details, roof pitch, 
ceiling heights, and insulation.</p>

<strong>Foundation Plan</strong><br />
A perimeter foundation plan is included as well with floor joists.

          
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Roof Plan</strong><br />
Showing the birds-eye view of the house, you see the slopes and pitches 
clearly called out, as well as the amount of overhang, and individual 
rafter locations from above.</p>
    <p><strong>Kitchen Detail</strong><br />
Unlike many other plans on the market, we include a full kitchen plan showing location of all shelving, cabinetry and appliances as seen from 
both an aerial and frontal view. We use standard size cabinets available at 
most hardware stores.</p>

<strong>Material List</strong><br />
Includes windows, doors, water heater, bath tub/shower, kitchen sink, dishwasher, range, washer/dryer and more.

          
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <h3>What's not included</h3>
    <p><b>Heating requirements</b><br />Because they vary by region we do not 
include these. Our plans are designed with a single fireplace heater. 
Depending on where you live, you may need to work with a local architect
 or engineer to submit plans that meet local requirements.</p>
    <p><b>A cut sheet</b><br />Cut sheets show the quantity of lumber needed.
 We do suggest the types of materials, however the quantity of each is not 
included. Windows, doors, kitchen cabinets and appliances are included 
with the drawings.</p>
    <p><b>Architect or Engineer seals</b><br />Some building departments 
require a licensed architect or engineer in your state to approve the 
plans. This often has to do with regional safety or energy issues,for 
example, hurricane safety in Florida, fire safety in California, energy 
 efficiency in New York, etc. Please contact your local building 
department to learn about the requirements in your area.</p>
    <h3>Other Notes:</h3>
    <p><b>Building Codes</b><br />These plans have been designed to meet the 
International Building Code. Some municipalities have additional 
restrictions or requirements. Please check with your local building 
department to verify that these plans meet your local codes.</p>
    <p><b>Square Footage</b><br />The square footage listed is an estimate. 
Unfortunately, not all municipalities calculate square feet in the same 
way. The square footage we list includes the bottom floor, plus the 
space on the top floor where the ceiling height is 5'0"" or taller.</p>
    <p><b>Altering Plans</b><br />
When you purchase a set of plans, it includes a license to build one 
house. Unfortunately, at this time, we do not offer alterations. If you 
require changes we suggest finding a local
architect or engineer who will do the alterations for you. For that 
purpose we have made the CAD and DFX files available online. With those 
files, your architect (or engineer) does not need to start from scratch; 
they can simply open the computer file and start making the adjustments 
you want.</p>
    <p>
</p>
    <p>TIP: Make sure the architect or engineer you select works with 
AutoCAD (or other similar software) and is willing to work with you on 
these plans. Some professionals will
only take a job if they do it from start to finish. By carefully 
selecting someone to work with these plans, you can save thousands of 
dollars.</p>

      <h3>
	Living Room</h3>
      <p>
	The ""living room"" comes with a built in desk and built in couch. 
Underneath the couch is extra storage. In between the front door and 
living room, there are 2 full size closets excellent for hanging 
clothes.</p>
      <h3>
	Kitchen</h3>
      <p>
	The kitchen is really just a kitchenette. It is a simple stainless 
steel counter with a sink, and surrounded by shelves. Below the sink, 
there is a small water heater, refrigerator, and a hot plate that is 
used for cooking. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/v/LoZ1nwAFaYg&amp;autoplay=1"" rel=""shadowbox;width=405;height=340"">See video.</a></p>
      <p>
	<strong>Can I add a dishwasher or laundry to the kitchen?</strong></p>
      <p>
	No. This house does not have any wiggle room to add more appliances.</p>
      <h3>
	Bedroom</h3>
      <p>
	The bedroom is in the loft. The XS-House has the smallest bedroom of 
all of our houses. It is large enough to fit a queen size bed, but that 
said, this house is a little small for 2 people. The mattress is foam 
(or like kind) so that it can be rolled up and fit through the loft 
opening. At its peak, the loft is 3'-2"" tall.</p>
      <h3>
	Bathroom</h3>
      <p>
	Like on many boats, the bathroom is the shower … and it is called a 
“wet bath”. We use metal diamond plate finishing on the walls that leave
 it with a modern look. The shower water is heated from the small water 
heater under the kitchen sink, and can last about 5 minutes. The toilet 
is a low flush RV toilet designed to conserve water. You can easily 
substitute a composting toilet.</p>
      <h3>
	Efficient and Warm</h3>
      <p>
	The XS-House features a <a href=""/pages/heaters/"">stainless steel fireplace</a>
 which keeps this house warm in temperatures -35 F. Because of its small
 size, its 16R insulation is sufficient to keep this house warm in the 
harshest of climates. By increasing the heater size to the Dickinson 
P-12000, the house can stay warm anywhere in Canada and Alaska.</p>
      <p>
	<strong>Can I add air conditioning?</strong></p>
      <p>
	Yes, a small ceiling a/c unit can be added to keep the house cool in any climate within the US.</p>
      <h3>
	Trailer</h3>
      <p>
	This small house is built on a 7' x 10' utility trailer. To learn more about utility trailers, <a href=""/blogs/tumbleweed/5912813-trailers"">read this...</a> Here is a <a href=""/pages/trailers/#10"">list of stores</a> that sell the trailer needed to build the XS-House.</p>

        <h3>
					XS-House Construction Plans include 15 total pages:</h3>
        <p>
					<strong>Floor Plans</strong><br />
					Detailed floor plans for both the downstairs and loft include 
pertinent dimensions, for walls, windows, rooms and door openings. 
You'll also find the location of all appliances on these plans as well.</p>
        <p>
					<strong>Exterior Elevations</strong><br />
					These plans include 4 elevation drawings showing the front, back and both sides. Siding and facia boards are called out.</p>
        <p>
					<strong>Electric Plans</strong><br />
					These pages include both the main floor and loft and show locations for outlets, light switches and lights.</p>
        <p>
					<strong>Transverse Section</strong><br />
					Perhaps one of the most important pages on any set of plans, the 
transverse section cuts the house in half and shows details such as wall
 thickness, roofing material details, flooring details, roof pitch, 
ceiling heights, and insulation.</p>
<strong>Foundation Plan</strong><br />
				Built on a trailer, the plans describe which trailer to buy, and how
 to attach to the house. Also included is the floor framing, showing the
 exact location of each joist and calling out pressure treated joists as
 needed.
				
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <p>
					&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
					<strong>Framing Plans</strong><br />
					These plans show the framing for all 4 walls, laying out the exact location of each stud.</p>
        <p>
					<strong>Kitchen and Cabinet Detail</strong><br />
					Unlike other many plans on the market, we include elevation plans 
for cabinets and kitchen counters (giving you the ability to see them 
from the top and from the front).</p>
<strong>Material List</strong><br />
				Includes windows, doors, water heater, bath tub/shower, kitchen 
sink, dishwasher, range, washer/dryer, insulation, lumber and more with 
quantities.

					&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>
					What's not included</h3>
        <p>
					<b>Roof Plans</b><br />
					This house an incredibly basic roof. We provide the dimensions for 
the rafters, but do not have a page showing the location and layout of 
the rafters.</p>
        <p>
					<b>Electric or Plumbing Isometrics</b><br />
					The plans show the location of outlets, lights, and fixtures, but 
do not include plans showing the location of pipes and wires inside the 
wall. Also, plans do not suggest types of wiring or plumbing pipes to 
use. We suggest working with a licensed electrician and plumber to make 
sure your house meets your specific needs.</p>
        <p>
					<b>Architect or Engineer seals</b><br />
					Some building departments require a licensed architect or engineer 
in your state to approve the plans. This often has to do with regional 
safety or energy issues,for example, hurricane safety in Florida, fire 
safety in California, energy efficiency in New York, etc. Please contact
 your local building department to learn about the requirements in your 
area.</p>
        <h3>
					Other Notes:</h3>
        <p>
					<b>Building Codes</b><br />
					In most municipalities this house can not be built on a permanent 
foundation. Please check with your zoning department to make sure you 
can live in a mobile structure on your property.</p>
        <p>
					<b>Square Footage</b><br />
					The square footage listed is an estimate. The square footage we 
list includes the bottom floor. It does not include the loft or porch.</p>
        <p>
					<b>Altering Plans</b><br />
					When you purchase a set of plans, it includes a license to build 
one house. Unfortunately, at this time, we don't offer alterations. We 
spend approximately 250-500 hours on these plans, and the details are 
incredibly specific. Alterations can easily run into thousands of 
dollars since one little change affects so many things.</p>

      <h3>
	Living Room</h3>
      <p>
	The ""living room"" comes with a built in desk and built in couch. 
Underneath the couch is extra storage. In between the front door and 
living room, there are 2 full size closets excellent for hanging 
clothes.</p>
      <h3>
	Kitchen</h3>
      <p>
	The kitchen is really just a kitchenette. It is a simple stainless 
steel counter with a sink, and surrounded by shelves. Below the sink, 
there is a small water heater, refrigerator, and a hot plate that is 
used for cooking. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/v/LoZ1nwAFaYg&amp;autoplay=1"" rel=""shadowbox;width=405;height=340"">See video.</a></p>
      <p>
	<strong>Can I add a dishwasher or laundry to the kitchen?</strong></p>
      <p>
	No. This house does not have any wiggle room to add more appliances.</p>
      <h3>
	Bedroom</h3>
      <p>
	The bedroom is in the loft. The XS-House has the smallest bedroom of 
all of our houses. It is large enough to fit a queen size bed, but that 
said, this house is a little small for 2 people. The mattress is foam 
(or like kind) so that it can be rolled up and fit through the loft 
opening. At its peak, the loft is 3'-2"" tall.</p>
      <h3>
	Bathroom</h3>
      <p>
	Like on many boats, the bathroom is the shower … and it is called a 
“wet bath”. We use metal diamond plate finishing on the walls that leave
 it with a modern look. The shower water is heated from the small water 
heater under the kitchen sink, and can last about 5 minutes. The toilet 
is a low flush RV toilet designed to conserve water. You can easily 
substitute a composting toilet.</p>
      <h3>
	Efficient and Warm</h3>
      <p>
	The XS-House features a <a href=""/pages/heaters/"">stainless steel fireplace</a>
 which keeps this house warm in temperatures -35 F. Because of its small
 size, its 16R insulation is sufficient to keep this house warm in the 
harshest of climates. By increasing the heater size to the Dickinson 
P-12000, the house can stay warm anywhere in Canada and Alaska.</p>
      <p>
	<strong>Can I add air conditioning?</strong></p>
      <p>
	Yes, a small ceiling a/c unit can be added to keep the house cool in any climate within the US.</p>
      <h3>
	Trailer</h3>
      <p>
	This small house is built on a 7' x 10' utility trailer. To learn more about utility trailers, <a href=""/blogs/tumbleweed/5912813-trailers"">read this...</a> Here is a <a href=""/pages/trailers/#10"">list of stores</a> that sell the trailer needed to build the XS-House.</p>

					XS-House Construction Plans include 15 total pages:</h3>
        <p>
					<strong>Floor Plans</strong><br />
					Detailed floor plans for both the downstairs and loft include 
pertinent dimensions, for walls, windows, rooms and door openings. 
You'll also find the location of all appliances on these plans as well.</p>
        <p>
					<strong>Exterior Elevations</strong><br />
					These plans include 4 elevation drawings showing the front, back and both sides. Siding and facia boards are called out.</p>
        <p>
					<strong>Electric Plans</strong><br />
					These pages include both the main floor and loft and show locations for outlets, light switches and lights.</p>
        <p>
					<strong>Transverse Section</strong><br />
					Perhaps one of the most important pages on any set of plans, the 
transverse section cuts the house in half and shows details such as wall
 thickness, roofing material details, flooring details, roof pitch, 
ceiling heights, and insulation.</p>
<strong>Foundation Plan</strong><br />
				Built on a trailer, the plans describe which trailer to buy, and how
 to attach to the house. Also included is the floor framing, showing the
 exact location of each joist and calling out pressure treated joists as
 needed.
				
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <p>
					&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
					<strong>Framing Plans</strong><br />
					These plans show the framing for all 4 walls, laying out the exact location of each stud.</p>
        <p>
					<strong>Kitchen and Cabinet Detail</strong><br />
					Unlike other many plans on the market, we include elevation plans 
for cabinets and kitchen counters (giving you the ability to see them 
from the top and from the front).</p>
<strong>Material List</strong><br />
				Includes windows, doors, water heater, bath tub/shower, kitchen 
sink, dishwasher, range, washer/dryer, insulation, lumber and more with 
quantities.

					&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>
					What's not included</h3>
        <p>
					<b>Roof Plans</b><br />
					This house an incredibly basic roof. We provide the dimensions for 
the rafters, but do not have a page showing the location and layout of 
the rafters.</p>
        <p>
					<b>Electric or Plumbing Isometrics</b><br />
					The plans show the location of outlets, lights, and fixtures, but 
do not include plans showing the location of pipes and wires inside the 
wall. Also, plans do not suggest types of wiring or plumbing pipes to 
use. We suggest working with a licensed electrician and plumber to make 
sure your house meets your specific needs.</p>
        <p>
					<b>Architect or Engineer seals</b><br />
					Some building departments require a licensed architect or engineer 
in your state to approve the plans. This often has to do with regional 
safety or energy issues,for example, hurricane safety in Florida, fire 
safety in California, energy efficiency in New York, etc. Please contact
 your local building department to learn about the requirements in your 
area.</p>
        <h3>
					Other Notes:</h3>
        <p>
					<b>Building Codes</b><br />
					In most municipalities this house can not be built on a permanent 
foundation. Please check with your zoning department to make sure you 
can live in a mobile structure on your property.</p>
        <p>
					<b>Square Footage</b><br />
					The square footage listed is an estimate. The square footage we 
list includes the bottom floor. It does not include the loft or porch.</p>
        <p>
					<b>Altering Plans</b><br />
					When you purchase a set of plans, it includes a license to build 
one house. Unfortunately, at this time, we don't offer alterations. We 
spend approximately 250-500 hours on these plans, and the details are 
incredibly specific. Alterations can easily run into thousands of 
dollars since one little change affects so many things.</p>

    <h3>Cost to Build</h3>
    <p><strong>Estimated Material Costs: $26,000 (370 sq ft) </strong> </p>
    <p><strong>Want to know how much it will cost to have a contractor build it for you?</strong> <br />
Visit <a href=""http://www.building-cost.net/CornersType.asp"" target=""_new"">Build-Cost.net</a> and follow these <a href=""http://static.shopify.com/s/files/1/0150/9532/t/4/assets/Cost-Guide.pdf?4754"" target=""_new"">instructions</a>. </p>
    <p><em>General notes about construction costs:</em>Costs for materials 
are almost the same in different regions but labor costs will vary 
greatly depending on where you live. We provide costs with a post and 
pier foundation. Depending on where you live, it is possible you will 
need an engineered foundation designed by a licensed contractor or 
engineer in your state.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Foundation</h3>
    <p>The house plans come with a post and pier foundation. However, it is 
possible to put this house on a slab foundation or even over a basement.
 You may need to work with an architect or engineer licensed in your 
state to get approval from the building department.</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Utilities and appliances</h3>
    <p>The kitchen includes a dishwasher, full size range with oven, and 
built in microwave. The tank-less on demand water heater ensures that 
you never run out of hot water, and tucks away completely out of view. A
 combo washer/dryer are tucked in the kitchen as well. A small fireplace
 is tucked nicely in the corner of the great room. </p>
    <p><strong>Can I install air conditioning?</strong> <br />
Our plans do not include an air conditioning unit, however you can install one. </p>
    <p><strong>What type of fireplace does the house have?</strong> <br />
We do not specify a particular fire place or heater because codes vary so 
much based on climate. We recommend discussing your options with a 
building contractor licensed in your state. When you build this house, <em>please</em> send us pictures. Since we do not build the house ourselves, we are dependent on you to supply us with real pictures.</p>

    <p><strong>Roof Plan</strong><br />
Showing the birds-eye view of the house, you see the slopes and pitches 
clearly called out, as well as the amount of overhang, and individual 
rafter locations from above.</p>
    <p><strong>Kitchen Detail</strong><br />
Unlike many other plans on the market, we include a full kitchen plan showing the location of all shelving, cabinetry and appliances as seen from 
both an aerial and frontal view. We use standard size cabinets available at 
most hardware stores.</p>

<strong>Material List</strong><br />
Includes windows, doors, water heater, bath tub/shower, kitchen sink, dishwasher, range, washer/dryer and more.

  
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <h3>What's not included</h3>
    <p><b>Heating requirements</b><br />Because they vary by region we do not 
include these. Our plans are designed with a single fireplace heater. 
Depending on where you live, you may need to work with a local architect
 or engineer to submit plans that meet local requirements.</p>
    <p><b>A cut sheet</b><br />Cut sheets show the quantity of lumber needed.
 We do suggest the types of materials, however the quantity of each is not 
included. Windows, doors, kitchen cabinets and appliances are included 
with the drawings.</p>
    <p><b>Architect or Engineer seals</b><br />Some building departments 
require a licensed architect or engineer in your state to approve the 
plans. This often has to do with regional safety or energy issues,for 
example, hurricane safety in Florida, fire safety in California, energy 
 efficiency in New York, etc. Please contact your local building 
department to learn about the requirements in your area.</p>
    <h3>Other Notes:</h3>
    <p><b>Building Codes</b><br />These plans have been designed to meet the 
International Building Code. Some municipalities have additional 
restrictions or requirements. Please check with your local building 
department to verify that these plans meet your local codes.</p>
    <p><b>Square Footage</b><br />The square footage listed is an estimate. 
Unfortunately, not all municipalities calculate square feet in the same 
way. The square footage we list includes the bottom floor, plus the 
space on the top floor where the ceiling height is 5'0"" or taller.</p>
    <p><b>Altering Plans</b><br />
When you purchase a set of plans, it includes a license to build one 
house. Unfortunately, at this time, we do not offer alterations. If you 
require changes we suggest finding a local
architect or engineer who will do the alterations for you. For that 
purpose we have made the CAD and DFX files available online. With those 
files, your architect (or engineer) does not need to start from scratch; 
they can simply open the computer file and start making the adjustments 
you want.</p>
    <p>
</p>
    <p>TIP: Make sure the architect or engineer you select works with 
AutoCAD (or other similar software) and is willing to work with you on 
these plans. Some professionals will
only take a job if they do it from start to finish. By carefully 
selecting someone to work with these plans, you can save thousands of 
dollars.</p>
